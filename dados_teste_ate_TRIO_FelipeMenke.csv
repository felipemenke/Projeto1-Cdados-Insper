" Budapest to Warsaw. The ground crew was very polite and helpful, when we had some problems with our lagguages they arranged our issue without any additional fees. Cabin crew was okay, the meal and drink service is nothing special (chocolate bar, coffee and water on a 55 minutes flight). The legroom is quite comfortable on the Q400 aircraft and we landed without any turbulance or problem. The flight took 55 minutes so you can bare the turboprop aircraft. LOT Polish Airlines says that they wanted to be Central- and Eastern Europes' favourite airline. Compare to the others it is time to develop. (Higher services for that price or the present service for lover price.)",Passive
"Bergerac to Stansted. Just come off a particularly unpleasant Ryanair flight where for the entire 1 hour and 20 minutes my wife and I were subjected to an all pervading smell of vomit. When initially challenged the cabin crew claimed to know nothing about this although we were offered a move to the row of sets in front of us (which was empty despite an otherwise full flight) and from whence the smell seemed to be emanating. Interestingly when we raised the issue of the foul smell with a different member of crew, on leaving the plane we were told that we had been offered a move and that there was a limited amount they could do to clean up vomit so despite the initial denial of knowledge the crew were well aware of the unpleasant conditions in which we had been expected to travel. I am well aware that Ryanair is a budget airline and am generally happy to accept that but do think they need to adhere to basic levels of cleanliness and be honest with passengers which sadly wasn't the case today.",Detractor
BRU-LIS. Flight left a few minutes late aircraft was at an off gate stand passengers had to reach the aircraft by bus. The flight in itself was very good clean aircraft very attentive crew and excellent service. Economy flex class of service.,Promoter
"Fleet of A319 and A320 in this route. Fast check in and fast track, what fast track! Took longer that other pax! Good lounge and well services and staffed one. Boarding ok, flight itself lacks the extra mile, they have no time nor the wish to make your money worth it. Same shame on the return. Bags first out which was a surprise.",Passive
4 Nov Houston-Doha QR714 and 15 Nov Doha-Houston QR713. Business class. Check in at Houston: the desk staff did not know whether coach class seats had power outlets. They do as anyone can find out on the Qatar Airways website. Continuing with the flight attendants. They all seemed to be in-training: could not remember to bring coffee or water even though they were very attentive just not very efficient. On both ways my choice of food was not available. I had to ask 2 or 3 times each way for dessert. The 777LR aircraft in a 2x2x2 business class configuration is not very comfortable being trapped for 16 hours between a window and a sleeping passenger. Doha Airport on both arrivals and departures is undeserving of the beautiful and progressive country of Qatar. Taking my hand luggage down the stairs up the bus off the bus up to immigration is a chore and nobody from the airline offered any help. Overall not a bad airline.,Passive
"We flew from Gatwick to Porto return. The flights were on time, crew on board were polite and helpful, the captain kept us informed on both the outward and return flights. The cabin and toilets were clean. Porto airport was well run and efficient, Gatwick which had filthy toilets was not such a pleasant experience.",Promoter
Flew from Shillong to Kolkata. Check in and cabin staff were pleasant and the flight was on time but the state of the plane: broken seats frayed seat belts all the panels were grimey the carpet was worn out. I hope the vital parts of the plane were better maintained.,Passive
" Flew biz class from Abu Dhabi to Paris, though economy Bangkok-Abu Dhabi. On the first segment (B-777) the seats were very tight and the food service poor, to be charitable. Worse was the biz class to Paris. Though the A380 seating was fine, the cabin service was terrible - disinterested and abrupt flight attendants and an incredibly limited selection of food and drinks, given the price and the 7.5 hour flight. I often fly Qatar on this route and there is really NO comparison in standard. Will go back to Qatar (or Emirates) rather than try to save a few EUR with the sub-standard Etihad.",Detractor
We flew 4 flights with South African Airways last month. We flew JFK-NY To Johannesburg then to Harare. The flight was horrendous. The 15 hour flight from JFK was especially terrible since the entertainment system never worked. For the entire time there was no visual entertainment nor audio. The worst part is that is was static the entire time! Also we were sitting in the fourth row from the front of economy class. They offered fish or beef. By the time they got to our row they ran out!,Detractor
Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur - I am a regular Cathay Pacific passenger and in their loyalty program. 90% of the time I fly with them I have to endure a hot cabin. Despite complaining to the staff the thermostat is set at a higher temperature than other airlines I have flown thus making the cabin stuffy and uncomfortable.,Passive
"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.",Promoter
Flew HKG-MEL on an A330-300. Went on board with great expectations and was left wanting to be honest. First the good things dedicated check in and boarding which some of the other airlines that fly PE could learn from. The gluten free meal I was served was tasteless and the entertainment system I found was nowhere near as good as the BA one was. Service was sketchy at best couldn't recommend them.,Passive
Short domestic hops between Kiev and Odessa. Their ground handling is fine online check-in works no delays. The planes were in fine condition. On the flight out they managed to serve hot snack (50 min long flight) inbound catering was rubbish. Crews friendly. The ticket price was a great deal of 75 USD roundtrip including taxes.,Promoter
"Frontier Airlines is the pits of the pits. First flight from Charlotte to Denver was the first disaster. Boarded and ready to go and told 4 times we had to wait because proper paperwork couldn't be found. Finally they just told us to get off. 90 minutes later the paperwork was found and we were told to reboard. Nearly everyone missed their connections. Then Denver to Portland was late departure and late arrival. As I type I'm sitting on the return flight from Portland to Denver. The fare went from $385 to $520 with all the nickel and diming. Bag fees, and seat fees.",Detractor
"I flew direct from Birmingham to Delhi and return with Air India recently in Business Class on a Boeing 787. The flights were timely, the cabin was spacious and the cabin crew worked very hard to make everyone as comfortable as possible. Although perhaps without some of the finesse and presentation of other airlines, the food was fine. I also found the entertainment system perfectly acceptable. Most important, the outward flight was only 7 hrs 50 mins. I have travelled to India with a range of airlines - some direct and some via middle-eastern hubs. Taking all factors into consideration (duration of flight, convenience of travel to airport, space in the cabin, waiting times for transfer flights and value for money) I would travel with this airline by choice on my next trip to India.",Passive
Booked my flight to Phoenix with the aircraft showing as a 320 only to discover when I received an itinerary change notification the equipment would be a rouge 319. My first flight with Rouge what a dreadful experience - old aircraft no leg room even if you 'rent' an ipad the entertainment options are dismal and no discount in the price. Having been a loyal supporter of Air Canada for many years with Super Elite/Elite status and having flown over 1-million miles I was extremely disappointed with the 'standard' that Air Canada is now offering under this brand for future travel I will certainly we looking for other options when travelling to any destinations being serviced by Air Canada rouge.,Detractor
Nov 16 2013 TG 476 SYD to BKK. The seat was comfortable. Food was quite poor for First Class some of it was not as described and some was inedible. Service was poor desite the fact that there was only two of us in First Class. When I asked for a top-up of ice my dirty glass was returned to me with the ice - lipstick marks and all. The toilets were continuously occupied by the staff so the two passengers had to wait - what a joke. Ground crew took forever to line up the portable staircase massive incompetence.,Detractor
"Surprisingly decent flights from YWG-YYC-OGG. Flights on time from YWG delayed slightly from YYC-OGG. Air Canada 767-300er (non rouge) is a solid air craft. Surprised however that the crew did not offer a free meal on a 7 hour international flight. Passengers we're restless about that. Decent pitch for a guy who is 6""4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of ""turbulence"" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked ""you know the seatbelt sign is on!"" Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary. This route for sure will be a rouge flight soon in which case avoid like the plague. But for standard AC mainline about as expected nothing wrong but a few things missing. Far superior to United service to Maui for example through Denver.",Passive
" Basel to Cape Town via Istanbul. When I arrived in Istanbul at 10pm we are informed that TK44 to Cape Town (departure at 1.55am) is delayed 4,5 hours. No reason for this Delay was announced.

  Worst service ever from Vueling Airlines. After making us wait 2 hours on a delay they finally cancelled our flight from Paris to Venice. Then told us that the next flight we would be on was 3 days later and would take 18 hours to get to Venice. Didnt put us up in a hotel even though it was 11pm by the time we sorted everything out.,Detractor
"  Chicago to Paris via Keflavik. We flew on Icelandair to take advantage of the free stopover program for our honeymoon to go to France for a week with a 3-day stopover in Reykjavik at the end. On the way out, our flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The crew was not forthcoming with information as the delays mounted. Once we boarded they insisted that we would ""make up time"" and be fine. They refused to give anymore information. We missed our flight, as we were 30 minutes late for our 745am departure. It seemed like dozens of people were on our connection and missed the flight. The customs officer remarked to us at passport check that this seems to happen quite frequently with Icelandair. Any information that you see about short connections being a problem or that they will hold a departure for a late arrival with numerous connecting passengers does not square with our experience. They rebooked all of us on a 1am flight and gave us hotel. We were sent to the wrong hotel and then sent to a hotel that didn't have availability. This was how we started our honeymoon. On our return trip, we were diverted from Chicago to Minneapolis inflight after circling around ORD for a while without getting much information from the crew. Upon landing in Minneapolis, we sat on the runway for 2 hours before regulations forced them to deplane the passengers. Our plane had to be towed into the gate and they were not forthcoming about the subsequent equipment failure other than that they couldn't get the engine to start. They were not able to get the plane to fly afterwards and did not provide any information about an alternate flight. They did not have hotels available so once we deplaned, everyone was stranded without information midnight. After a couple hours, once most people had left to figure out accommodation on their own, they finally arranged for hotels. My wife and I rebooked onto a Southwest Airlines flight as we still had not received information on any type of return flight. I strongly recommend against booking with Icelandair due to the lack of communication about delays and the failure to provide support to passengers and the variety of other issues associated with twice being stranded.",Detractor
" As we were checking in for our return trip, Ixtapa to Edmonton via Calgary on Feb 15, 2018, the check-in lady at Ixtapa airport removed my husbands passport from a plastic protective cover, scanned it, and then put it all back together again. When we arrived in Edmonton and went to do our customs declarations, we found that she had tucked the passport cover and the photo page into the plastic protective cover, and in doing so, ripped my husband's passport right through his photo. This was the first trip taken on a brand new 10-year passport, and it was ruined. We looked up the procedure of replacing a damaged passport and discovered that it is full cost of $160 plus new photo's of $35 -- plus it requires as much information as though you've never had a passport before - far more than simply renewing an expired one. A lot of unnecessary expense and hassle. We contacted Sunwing the very next day - on Feb 16, 2018, and advised them of what had happened, and requested that they cover the cost of replacement, since it was their employee who destroyed it. It is now April 18 - beyond 2 months later. We have not had any communication with Sunwing, except an email saying that they are experiencing higher than usual volumes and their investigations are delayed. As far as the trip, we just purchased the flight only as we had our own accommodations, it was adequate. Food is nothing special. I was not impressed that Sunwing changed their policy on flights-only to exclude one free piece of baggage included in your price. Our baggage ended up costing us an additional $115 - nothing but a money-grab, for sure! It was a little bit cheaper if you pre-buy it online, as opposed to paying at the counter. We chose this flight because it was more direct than any of the other flights available (Just a drop-in to Calgary to pick up more passengers) and the price was good, even though we had to pay extra for baggage. The return flight was in a much older plane and the seating was extremely tight, but we endured and everything was on schedule. We chose this flight because it was more direct than any of the other flights available.",Passive
"Singapore Airlines was always noted most for their cabin crew attentiveness, you read it still in their proud history in the inflight magazine. I think the slogan was 'Singapore girl, what a great way to fly'. Nowadays if you are lucky enough to be in business you will still come across one of these amazing women. However, you are more likely to get the totally uncommitted new fleet of cabin crew in economy who view the public as a bit of a nuisance and eye contact has gone. Tragedy that whoever is in charge of training cabin staff for this airline is doing a terrible job and losing loyal customers. On my flight, SQ217, Singapore to Melbourne, 10.45 on July 7, I had a rude male steward ever who did not smile once. Back to Qantas for this frequent Australia to Europe passenger.",Passive
My last trip with Ryanair was Modlin-Hahn-Modlin at the beginning of December 2013. Both flights were excellent. Each time I'm in Europe I indulge myself in city hopping. It's only possible thanks to Ryanair's prices. You get what you have paid for: Affordable and safe transport from A to B. Pros: Price modern planes efficient and friendly cabin crew. On time arrivals. Cons: If you have additional luggage you have to pay for it. Make sure your carry on meets the exact size requirements. Seats are a bit tight but for the price I paid I can live with it Comments: If you are budget conscious and adventure oriented definitely go with Ryanair. Really good airline to choose if you like to travel.,Promoter
"  Flew Melbourne to Hobart with Qantas. The plane was quite old and my seat was stained with food from the previous flight. Furthermore, the iPad provided for in-flight entertainment was not working, which I guess is because it ran out of battery. Luckily, it was a short 1hr flight so the iPad wasn't really necessary. Despite these shortfalls, the service crew was friendly and they served breakfast quickly. Although it was a cold breakfast with yogurt, fruit bars and dried cranberries, it tasted good. Overall, the flight is not fantastic, but the good service crew managed to make the short flight better.",Passive
" Jakarta to Yogyakarta. A short but pleasant flight. Even though it is just a short flight, all of the services expected from a full fledged carrier is being given. Meal is not given because it is short distance, but light snacks and drinks are still given. All of the flight attendants are really pleasant, and all of the niceties is present even though it is just a short flight. The landing on the other hand is a bit rougher than usual Garuda Indonesia's flight.",Promoter
"  Stockholm to Bangkok via Doha. Check-in operated by SAS staff at Stockholm opens 3hrs before, a little slow as they validate visas and pass people along to pay extra baggage where applicable, but nothing worryingly so - all outsourced check-in is the same in my experience. Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour. Meals were good, staff were great - very friendly, toilets were always clean. However I've cancelled my return flights in April 2018 taking the $200 on tax refund and putting it towards another airline. Qatar need to address the seating on the 787 or at least remove the under seat IFE boxes.",Passive
" Valencia to Milan Malpensa via Madrid. Good aircraft (two flights). High price and luggage not included in price (one 15Kg bag for two passengers). This is not explained in the site when buying ticket. Thus I had to pay 60 Euro for a single bag. In addition, Fee requested for selecting seats. Thus: a return only flight for 2 people was 400E = 200E each. Airlines are profiting of you: luggage allowances and seat selection fees (as well as priority).",Passive
" Lisbon to Frankfurt. Business class Check in at Lisbon Airport is on the main floor, but there are no clear indications. Courteous check in, fast and efficient. Could not check in online. Boarding was ok, a bit confused. Take off was on time. Business class is the same as economy, only the middle seat is empty. They serve lunch with 2 options. I do not drink alcohol, so can't review the wines. Food was ok, nothing outstanding. Cabin crew is polite and attentive. Arrive on time in FRA.",Passive
" Tokyo to Houston via Beijing. My flights to and from Japan were fine. As far as the flight, outside of the casual method of boarding everyone at once, the flight had no problems. The food was typical airline fare. The attendants were friendly. The entertainment was a little glitchy but it didn't ruin my experience. They say not to use digital devices onboard but that didn't seem to be enforced on either of my flights. I'm sure some people might think this review is a plant (related to an employee even) but I want people to know that I had a normal flying experience and think staff should get credit where credits due. They worked hard to make passengers happy. If not for a flight that had more connections, I'd consider flying with them considering the bargain price.",Passive
"  Flew Ukraine International for the first time from Barcelona to Kiev, and then from Kiev on to Lviv. This was our first time going to Ukraine, so we didn't know what to expect. Check-in in Barcelona was quite slow as they seemed understaffed, but the boarding experience was pleasant and the plane ended up being about 2/3 full. The plane was in fairly good shape, and the crew was efficient and spoke passable English â€“ though they were not particularly friendly by Western standards. Food/beverage was all buy-onboard, but large sandwiches were only 3 Euro and seemed to be very popular. I paid 2 Euro for a chocolate bar and a soda, also very reasonable. They are cash-only onboard, so make sure to have small bills/coins. Water was complimentary. Transiting Kiev was relatively easy, though we were transferring to a domestic flight so we had to clear Ukrainian immigration at Kiev. This process was pretty efficient, as there is a separate line for ""Non-EU"" foreign passports and the handful of Americans aboard our flight from Barcelona had this line largely to ourselves. All signs in the Kiev airport are in Ukrainian, Russian, and English, so it was easy to get around. They did not make us collect our luggage and re-check it onto the domestic flight, which was a nice change from American airports. Going through security again to reach the domestic departure area was hectic, as nobody seemed to really respect the line and would cut in at will. The staff in the domestic terminal spoke good English, and were helpful if asked. The Lviv flight was delayed due to heavy fog, but announcements were made in all three languages about the delay. Overall it was better than I expected. I'm not sure I'd choose them for a longhaul, but they got us where we wanted to go at an excellent price.",Promoter
"I booked a business class flight from Heathrow to Accra via Amsterdam. Not a pleasant experience. I checked in early, had my seats confirmed for both legs of the journey and turned up to the Gate to be told there was a problem. The check-in guy took my boarding pass and, after a few minutes gave it back to me saying the problem had been solved and that I could board. I had the same seat on the first flight, but did not look at the second. Big mistake. They had put me on standby despite me having checked in earlier. When I got to Amsterdam I was told the flight had been heavily oversold and there was nothing they could do. I went to the gate to find total chaos. Loads of people were without seats and they were asking for volunteers to miss the flight. In the end, after much argument I got an Economy seat. I have sent two emails to KLM customer service but with no reply. I got sent a completely incomprehensible automatically generated email which nobody I show it to can explain. So, here I am - initially chucked off the flight, paid for Business class and got Economy and no response to my emails. What rubbish customer service. I fly long haul continually for business and will make sure I do not use KLM again.",Detractor
" Delhi to London. Earlier this month I reviewed the outbound sector of my trip, this review covers the inbound sector on the 31st January. Although the plane was a Boeing 787, it was quite an old one and hence badly maintained. The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew? I imagine not because otherwise these reviews would not be published.",Passive

"Kamloops to Sydney via Vancouver with Air Canada. I have used Air Canada a lot for my business travel over a number of years, and I have always been satisfied with my experience. Recently, my partner and I planned a trip to Australia for the very first time. I have never flown Air Canada ""internationally"" before so I wasn't sure what to expect. We found our check in online to be very smooth and quick the night before. The first flight from YKA to YVR was smooth like always. The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in ""Premium Economy"", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight. We arrived into SYD in the morning, feeling fairly fresh and rested from our flight. Overall, all 4 flights with Air Canada were very good. Everything was on schedule, and the staff that we interacted with were very helpful to us on our journey. If we go back to Australia again at some point, we will definitely take Air Canada again.",Promoter
"Flew Swiss from London to Johannesburg via Zurich in Business Class. This was my first time flying with them, and I was very impressed. The IFE is not as advanced as some airlines and the aircraft are older but the service, cleanliness and quality of food and drink make up for this. The mix of age and experience of cabin crew was a definite plus point and the punctuality of arrival and departure appreciated. A very enjoyable trip. I would be happy to recommend Swiss and will fly with them again.",Promoter
" It was hard to fault this short haul flight with Qantas. The terminal at SYD is spacious with easy self-service bag drop and helpful staff if anything goes wrong. There are many shops, cafes and facilities right up to the gates. Boarding was efficient and on-time both on our outbound and return flights. The real gem of these flights were the polite and friendly to a fault crews who greeted each passenger with warmth and by name on arrival. During the flight despite it being only a short 1 hour trip, the crew were professional and delivered a snack and drinks service which was very tasty and very much appreciated. The whole process went smoothly from beginning to end and you can't really ask for much more. Qantas' short haul domestic product is certainly worth it over cheaper rivals, especially if you have checked luggage which is included in the ticket price. A great experience.",Promoter
"Flew DEL-ORD and back. Poorly maintained aircraft B777. Worn out seats. Cleanliness sub-optimal both for the cabin and in the lavatories. Staff only does the process of rushing through meal service thrice during the 15 hour flight and switch off lights rest of the time - unlike some of the good East Asian airlines, there is no one regularly going through the cabin to see if passengers need anything. One can always go back and ask for tea/coffee. There is water/juices kept in the aisle but they really don't come back to see if replenishments are needed. In-flight entertainment inadequate for such a long flight. Flight path either not switched on in time or grossly inaccurate. Safety vests hanging out from below most seats. Food quality and quantity both average. On the forward flight, the salad was spoilt and I had to return it. Only good thing is the cost - I had purchased a hugely discounted ticket - cost far less than what was available on other airlines.",Passive
"Third time flying the British Airways A380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = Â£Â£Â£'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration. A question for BA: We really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using BA? I do not mean cost.",Passive
"I flew with Delta from Chicago O'hare to Pisa via Detroit and Amsterdam. Between the big three American airlines (United, AA, and Delta), Delta would be my favorite. On all the flights they were organized, fast and on-time. From Chicago to Detroit, which was flown on a crj900, lasted only an hour but they still handed out snacks and drinks. On that flight my family and I were put in Comfort+ for no extra charge. Comfort+ had very nice legroom and very good seat width. The long haul flight from Detroit to Amsterdam was flown with a 767-400, which is in my opinion the nicest plane that Delta flies. With a 2-3-2 layout and me traveling in a party of 3 made it so we traveled in the middle section and were still undisturbed by an extra person next to us. It made the entire flight feel a whole lot more private. The IFE systems were great and had plenty of movies to watch. Were left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This made it super easy to catch my connection. At Amsterdam we had plenty of time to relax and explore the airport. We had to fly with Transavia, one of the low-cost carriers linked with KLM, and that was slightly chaotic in boarding but comfortable inflight. We arrived on time and I'm impressed with the quality of Delta.",Promoter
"  Boston to Fort Myers. Most unfriendly staff ever. The TSA employees were friendlier than the women at the check in counter. However, I can deal with subpar employees, what's a tough pill to swallow is when you are told your outside of their 45 minute check in window by 10 minutes but you're waiting in line for over 15 because they have one woman working the counter. So 99 dollars later and an 8 hour wait in the airport for the next available flight was my option. Airline is a joke. Pay the few extra bucks for another airline that won't screw you over.",Detractor

Flight Porto-Brussels 17 Nov 2014 Business Class (origin from Rio de Janeiro) Fokker 100 operated by Portugalia. The plane was at least 30 year old it should be in a museum and not flying anymore.

However to be fair the staff was particularly nice smiling caring and professional (usually not the case with TAP where staff are usually demotivated careless if not rude).,Detractor
"Boston to Malaga via Lisbon. The problems started in Boston as the flight was 90 minutes late leaving. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge problem, but we missed our connecting flight from Lisbon to Malaga, after being told by numerous TAP staff that we'd make the flight. We were able to get a later flight to Malaga, 11 hours after we arrived in Lisbon. Worse still was the return flight. The Malaga to Lisbon plane, which was scheduled to depart at around 11am, eventually left at 9pm, so our connecting flight to Boston had left hours earlier. We had to rebook a flight from Malaga to Madrid on Air Europa, spent the night in Madrid, and flew out at 6am on a KLM flight to Amsterdam and then a Delta flight from Amsterdam to Boston. There were some TAP employees who were helpful (especially when it came to rebooking our flights) but the overall experience was dreadful. The entertainment system on the long haul flight was cheap (compared with, say, Delta or Virgin Atlantic). I won't fly TAP again.",Detractor

"Undependable, rude service. My last round trip one flight was delayed 7 hrs (weather delay which I know you can't control) the other 4hrs. The flight with 8 hr delay - myself and a few passengera went out to the desk because we could not rebook at gate which doesn't make sense. There was 15 to 20 people in line, and five behind counter and two standing infront. Four were helping the same customer, 2 were on their phones, and the last one was sitting on the luggage carousel. When I finally got to front I asked about re-booking, she informed me there were only 4 seats for following days flight. Told if I want to get where I'm going I should just be patient and wait. I smiled and walked away and ""patiently waited"". On my return flight, it was at 1.30pm, I started getting emails at 8am that it was going to be delayed and gate changed. I paid for seat and checked bag online in order to get through faster, but there was no bag drop line so had to wait in line for 40 minutes to get a tag for bag. When got to the counter I was told the flight was delayed again and L7 was the new gate. When arrived at airports both times after landing late, had to sit on runway for an hour to get a gate.

All very rushed with no extra offer of wine or even coffee. Breakfast terrible , HK - Melbourne, the same but this time nothing served till nearly 2 hours into the flight which left at 00,15, I as well as other passengers had to ask for some water. Then food again rushed, sort of very un professional , mine this time was so hot, I had to wait for it to cool a little. Drinks trolley came at least 10 mins after the meal service. and no extra drinks or coffee. Breakfast again , not good. It seemed the staff were in training or, or. Not sure if I would consider Cathay again. I like flying to Europe, twice a year via HK or Singapore but usually take Turkish Airlines from Asia, such a great experience with well trained staff and very good food.",Detractor

From Kuwait to New York it was a Boeing 777. There were plenty of vacant seats. Entertainment system on a lot of seats did not work. Again food and service was good. It was a bargain to fly from Islamabad to JFK and return fare under $950. On the way back from JFK to Islamabad the same thing. All flights left and arrived on time. They serve no alcohol and their entertainment system is not the best. But they provide a great value for your money.,Passive

BRU to DUB. As a regular flyer with Aer Lingus (Gold Circle Prestige) it is with regret that despite improvements in some areas (e.g. improved lounge) Aer Lingus has difficulty differentiating itself with its competitor Ryanair and passengers are not always the highest priority. Despite a stated policy allowing a cabin case and a personal item such as a laptop bag Aer Lingus has not communicated this to ground crew which led to a poor experience. It is not acceptable for a passenger to be castigated for exceeding the luggage limit when in fact this is not the case. It is also standard practice with other airlines that bags taken from passengers due to lack of space can be collected at the door of the plane rather than at the baggage belt - this is crucial when transfers are involved. Another recent trend is that the seat belt sign is left on until service is completed - a benefit for crew and cabin service rather than passenger comfort. Aside from these issues the flight crews have been generally pleasant on recent trips and 7 out of my last ten flights have been on time although thankfully I had built in enough time to make transfer flights.,Passive
"19th August GLA-DXB DXB-MRU. Poor experience at silver skywards check in glum emirates staff when asked about upgrading (paid) to business class told ""speak to someone at the lounge"".

Upon boarding I was told ""no seats in business class"" despite what lounge said. Flight great FA's a mix of good and poor food and drink good IFE good.

" Melbourne to Oslo via Doha, returning from London. I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers - it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane. Onboard wifi is available too - 15 mins free or more at a cost if required. The entertainment on board was great and I didn't run out of things to watch or listen too.",Promoter
Chennai-Dubai and Dubai-Mumbai a couple of months ago. Old A-321 aircraft with faded seats and no inflight entertainment system. Surly cabin crew who had a feeling that they were doing a favor to passengers. On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation. With this kind of flight experience it is no wonder that most of the traffic on the Gulf routes from India deviates towards the Middle Eastern carriers.,Detractor
 The journey started with very friendly ground staff at Frankfurt Airport. Both legs were smooth and pleasant flights. The seats are ok. For long distance flights they have been a bit hard for me which was uncomfortable during the last two hours of the first leg. The IFE offered a nice selection of Chinese and international movies and series. Compared to other airlines it was a smaller selections but enough for an entertaining flight in multiple languages. The cabin crew was nice and never acted bothered or unfriendly. They had an open ear for the passengers. The only little thing that has been noticed is the English language of the crew. It was challenging to understand them due a very strong accent. The crew did their best but for unexperienced speakers it would be tough to understand. The food on both flights has been good for economy. Both warm food options and the snack was very tasteful. The connection at Beijing airport was fast and as comfortable as possible. After security the waiting area for transit passengers offered a good view of the gates and lots of vending machines and snack and coffeshop. Air China positively surprised me with their good service for cheap price.,Passive

Travelled on 10/09/14 - having booked airport wheelchair and assistance for boarding to gate and vice versa for departure and both return flight. To my dismay no wheelchair had been arranged at the Dusseldorf Weeze airport. Bus driver unlocked padlock of chained up wheelchairs. Stewards failed to inform arrival airport of my pre-booked requirements. Staff should also insure that passenger take their allocated seats - had a lady whose body posture was extremely intimidating and hostile because she could not get out fast enough caused by her sitting in the wrong seat. Flying back same problem again - staff did not inform Stansted airport of my pre-booked requirements. Was stranded for more than 15 minutes outside the aircraft on the tarmac before porter with wheelchair turned up. I shan't forget the blank expression on the faces of the aircrew staff either which made me feel very uncomfortable I'm sure it can be improved with more staff training and please slow down the food and drink trolleys as no one gets a chance to buy anything at this speed and it might cause an accident.,Detractor

As a long time customer of Air Canada I will now be looking at other airlines for my frequent trips from Vancouver to California. Rouge represents a major drop in quality from Air Canada. There is no entertainment centre and the leg room is the same that I experienced on an Air Transat charter flight when we were packed in like sardines - my knees were touching the seat in front of me. Anyone over 5' 11' is simply not going to fit in the tiny seats. From my perspective this has severely damaged the Air Canada brand and presents a big opportunity for its competitors.,Detractor

What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful.

"London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita via Doha. I heard positive reviews about this airline from friends so I thought I'd book my flight to Japan with Qatar Airways. Days before my flight I got the opportunity to upgrade, which I did as I had money to spare and for a long haul I thought this would be perfect. Dressed in a t-shirt, joggers and trainers upon entering the aircraft and presenting my ticket for business class I got a look of disgust - almost as though I didn't and should have been there. How dare someone dressed for eight months worth of travelling be seated in business class right? Offended to say the least. The seats and food was wonderful. Everything you expect from a good airline like Qatar Airways and for business class. It was my first time flying business so I was definitely enjoying it despite the look I received when I arrived onboard. I decided to ignore this although it gets worse. Everybody in the entire cabin got the best of service. Not me! It's almost like they were deliberately not willing to serve me a drink or food etc. I found this service pretty shocking. 11 hours on a plane and served two drinks? Disgusted. I hate complaining and causing drama but personally this goes to show people judge you. I had the money to spend on my flight and therefore I should have received the same service as everyone else in that cabin. I'm pretty let down as this was my first time with Qatar Airways. You should never judge someone by the clothes they're wearing or lack of make up etc. So I didn't look like a business class flyer but I'm a nice person who wanted to enjoy me flight and ended up feeling tense thanks to the staff onboard my flight. Will make me think twice about upgrading with them or even flying with them. Next time I'll stick with economy class where aparently I belong. I'll be sure to share this experience with friends and family.",Passive
Travelling from Edinburgh to Stockholm with a connection at Copenhagen. It was a poor experience altogether. Check-in at Edinburgh was a nightmare. We had to queue up for more than an hour even though we only had hand luggage to carry. No fast check-in was available and there were only 2 members of staff to assist a very busy flight. Both flights were delayed. The second flight (CPH-ARN) was delayed by almost 2 hours because we were waiting for the aircraft to come from Tel Aviv. Both flights were crowded there was not enough space in the overhead lockers and since seats are pretty narrow we could not even place our luggage underneath the seat in front of us.

A food and beverage cart run down the aisle charging about 2 bucks for drinks and snacks and almost no one bought anything. I wonder if they flushed all the coffee down the toilet at the end of the flight? I don't think the model is cost effective for Poland. Probably more coffee and tea wasted than paid for by customers.

You really do get what you pay for. They are cheap and that's what you should expect on board. Their boarding desk in JFK is in the back of the airport with no signs to help you locate it.

I took two long trips from LA to Bangkok via Seoul the other flying LA to Beijing return from Hong Kong to LA. Both were in economy. The service is professional and attentive throughout. The bathrooms are kept spotlessly clean. The food is nothing to write home about but the option of Korean dishes is welcome. The entertainment selection is decent. The seats are very close together and the space is cramped. The only good seats are in the back of the plane but it is hard to reserve those. In previous years once one booked a ticket it was possible to call the airline and book the seats. Now they cancelled this option and one can only select seats 30 days in advance. They also tend to overheat the planes so plan to take your layers off after you board. Overall I would say it is 7 out of 10 and I'd recommend it to anyone who does not mind being cramped during flight.,Passive

"  Istanbul to Sydney via Singapore. First time I had flown Singapore Airlines in over 25 years and I had very high expectations. First impression was that the interior looked clean but slightly dated. The seats were comfortable but the armrests didn't come all the way up - which was annoying. Had 3 seats to myself on one flight but couldn't stretch/sleep due to the arms rests. Legroom was above average at 32 inches and much appreciated. The individual TV was very old and screen quality was poor. The cheap headphones meant that the sound was fuzzy and after 30 mins I gave up. This was the case on all 4 long haul flights. Very disappointing. Selection was average. Compared to Emirates or Turkish Airlines it was remarkably bad. Even the moving map was ancient. Needs massive improvement. Service was excellent through the flight. Crew very polite and proactive. Food / drinks were generally good. Asian dishes were excellent and they gave me a second hot meal on request. Icecream for dessert was fun. Snacks were also provided as were drinks between meals. Steel cutlery was appreciated. Hot towel service is excellent. Toilets were always kept clean with nice amenities. They were also larger than on other airlines. All in all, I was really looking forward to a 5 Star experience but the PTV really let me down. Ruined the flight given I had over 38 hours flying time on this trip and had been really looking forward to seeing some movies / tv etc. With the new economy seats, Singapore Airlines will be a 5 star product but without them they are barely 3.5.",Passive

Cusco to Lima. I will never fly with Avianca ever again. First thing that went wrong is they pushed back our flight an hour without telling us. The plane shows up even later then was planned. They then unload the plane in like 15 minutes and loaded us in 20 minutes. As soon as we land in Lima we waited on the plane without a gate or anything for about 30 minutes before they even pull up busses or stairs for us to walk down. Once we take the bus to the baggage claim they tell us that only four bags made it. They lost my bag along with all 20 other people I was flying with as well. The lady that helped me had no idea what she was doing. She told me that United would be dropping my bag off to my house in the United States which they won't do and I will have to drive two hours to the airport to get my bag which avianca lost.

Transit from Europe to Asia easy even with only short transit time. Long haul seatpitch ok. IFE good but very limited choice. Food okay. However still weird that one has to pay for everything between the meal services. Even crew seems a bit embarrassed about that. Cabin crew (except for one FA on the way back) is reserved some clearly showing that they don't like their job. One already knows when advertising states that water bottle in seat pocket in Y means no or only one drinks service during the flight. Transfer coming from Asia a bit longer which is clear due to Schengen but some of the screening staff is borderline racist if one is not Caucasian looking. Still think value for money as one gets what one pays for.,Passive

I recently booked a flight to Denver from Kansas City trip cost was $376 avoiding other airports I wanted a one way flight to and fro. Price went to $925. Then while boarding the flight we have a prop plane. The seats were so narrow and of course no air-conditioning. The flight took an exceptionally long time back and forth from Kansas to Denver. I don't understand the United Airline Magazine says how their improving the flight for the customer. I think its time the execs take a flight cause your badly mistaken.,Detractor
"  Leeds Bradford to Heathrow. Service is equal to Ryanair and EasyJet. I've been flying with BA regularly for last 4 years and I can't get my head around what is going on. Complimentary drinks replaced with a Buy on Board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now! Really just appalling. There is no competition on the LBA route, but I certainly won't pay anything extra to travel with BA from now on if there are alternatives available - Ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually!",Detractor
"This was my return flight of my trip in the USA. From Europe to the USA we had an Airbus A380 which was modern and quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was on a Boeing 747. The aircraft was quite old with seats which weren't so comfortable but at least fully OK. The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something. The food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights (if you book early and fares not too high) than for longer ones. One reason more is that connections in Heathrow are easy when you have two BA flights, transfer done in 35mins.",Passive
" Freetown to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. The Freetown - Amsterdam leg was with the old Business Class seats, whereas the second leg to Hong Kong was with their new World Business Class seats. Whilst the second leg was obviously a superior product, the old seats were acceptable for a reasonably short flight. Crew on both legs were very good - friendly, outgoing, and attentive, and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Food was good, though the selection of wine was reasonably limited and not particularly exciting nor high-end. Crew made sure I was constantly topped up. Really loved their crockery and cutlery - cool designs and a nice touch. Bathrooms had good Zenology products, but the amenity kits were seriously lacking - no body care products at all. The IFE was good - there was enough choice, and it was a pleasure to watch on the large screens. Loved the little houses filled with gin that they passed out. Really enjoyed both flights.",Promoter
Frankfurt-Greece Zurich to Munich Munich-Toulouse Toulouse-Frankfurt on different days all within 8 days in July. Very pleased with the service and smiles. Friendly staff. All are short-haul so no entertainment. There were one or two flights with proper meals but the others only had snacks and drink. The food was all right as they are very short. The seats were hard but has okay comfort level. Some times check-in get a little confusing for the crew but that's my own problem as I transferred a lot. Pretty satisfied overall!,Passive
" It was an international travel from Fukuoka (Japan) to Delhi (India) via Seoul (South Korea) with Korean Air. Due to the bad weather condition, the airline was kept on postponing the estimated time of departure in Fukuoka (Japan) Airport. The flight from Fukuoka to Seoul was 5.30 hours delayed approximately. During that time the staff at Fukuoka airport provided a can of coffee and nothing else. Anyway, I was worried since I needed to board another Korean Air flight from Seoul to Delhi. Unfortunately, I couldn't board that flight. I contacted airlines staff and the staff suggested for me to take the next days flight from Seoul to Delhi. The staff happily showed incapability to provide any lounge/hotel for one night stay as well. I was supposed to reach Seoul in afternoon but landed late evening. I was completely exhausted and hungry also knowing that I needed to spend one night and a day until the afternoon (15 hours approximately) before boarding the flight to Delhi. Now, the flight to Delhi kept being postponed. During this time period, I contacted airport enquiries and tried to contact airline staff but couldn't find the airline staff. The airline didn't provide any food since they didn't bother to contact me at all. Note that the flight which was supposed to take off in the afternoon was finally rescheduled to 20.00 hours approximately which made my spend 24 hours at Incheon Airport (Seoul) approximately. It was indeed a pathetic experience and I was left with no energy. The airline should treat the passenger properly and also provide accommodation if flights are rescheduled. I would definitely not recommended Korean Air to anyone.",Detractor

"  Sydney to Bangkok. I haven't used Thai for about 4 years due to their aircraft choices and pricing. However being a return trip to Sydney from Thailand in Holiday season choices were limited. My original booking was in economy although most times I use business (Christmas holiday pricing again) but I intended to try for a paid standby upgrade at the airport for this return flight, which I was offered. To my surprise Thai Airways have now increased the upgrade cost by around 30 - 35% and is now very poor value and not recommended for anyone that may be considering it. The aircraft was an elderly 747-400 which was showing it's age. The business class seats (upstairs) were angled lie flat, very worn with faded upholstery. These are the same business seats Thai have used for close on 15 years and are way past their use by date. Considering they are flying Boeing 787's to Brisbane and the new A350 to Melbourne I cannot see why we still have this worn out 747 on Thai's most important Australian market, Sydney. The food service has improved slightly from what I can remember with the food now plated by the flight attendants before serving however they still insist on a totally French wine list where most other airlines offer some Australian or NZ wines on the route. The inflight entertainment is pretty poor with limited choices compared to competitor airlines. The screen size and clarity is also poor due to the age of the system. I will continue to avoid Thai on this route as much as possible as their business class fares are some of the most expensive on the route yet they offer what is, by far, the worst product against their competitors (both direct flights and ones with acceptable transit stopovers).",Detractor

I would not recommend Etihad. I flew from Perth to Munich via Abu Dhabi and return. Food was generally terrible. All options were gone by the time they got to me leaving only fish which I don't eat. After a fuss they found me a no-fish meal. The hot food is served in a plastic-lined container the taste of which went all through the food. Every corner is cut with the airline. the hot towels are disposable they do not separate or recycle any of their waste the blankets are thin and small barely covering your arms. The service is not very polite and frequent. The cabins are clean and presentable but that's about it. It is a very cramped cabin and for the price which was more than other airlines that offer great service its really not worth it.,Detractor

From the moment we checked flight departure time and were incorrectly informed resulting in waiting to board for over 3 hours, to the incorrect arrival time as stated on the IFE screen. A 12 hour flight with only 1 main meal plus a snack served - without any drinks. Their idea of an Asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and rice, drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away. Very uncomfortable hard seat, aisles so small that most passengers had their legs stuck out in the aisles and finally finishing with nearly an hour getting thru customs to then having to wait 20 minutes for my luggage. Can you please get off your backsides BA, and fly economy with Singapore Airlines as they still realize it's human beings they are transporting.",Detractor
LHR-HKG via DXB. The seat pitch was surprisingly generous aboard the A380 EK006 from Heathrow to Dubai. The ICE entertainment was superb the staff were friendly and the catering was above average. What I disliked the most was the boarding 'process' they had to make it sound 'so grand'. I sat at the front and by the time I boarded and requested for eyeshades they were gone already. Also it is very hard to hear what the guy was saying as there were a battle of voices between our flight and the Qantas flight at the next gate. The queues for transfer were very long in Dubai but it was pretty inefficient. However it takes 40 minutes to get from the first gate to the second although at a leisurely pace. The second flight from DXB-HKG was far more horrible. We had to endure the horrendous 3-4-3 configuration. The ICE entertainment on the 777-300 was not as modern as the A380 thus the person behind me had to press the screen with tremendous force every time to get his TV working. The screens were also far smaller and much harder to operate. But in terms of service it was really average. In conclusion the first flight was close to being perfect and the second flight slightly disappointing.,Passive

Western film selection was reasonable but very lacking in terms of TV shows etc. Staff were professional courteous and attentive although their English was very limited in my experience outside of the most straightforward questions.

My wife and I despite having the same booking number could not be seated together but this may have been due to changing our flight the week before. This also meant a downgrade to economy but on this short flight from San Francisco to San Diego doesn't make much difference as there is little on offer in either class.

VIE-CDG-VIE. When I arrived at the airport they told me at the boarding gate that my ticket was cancelled a day before from a service agent.

" Barcelona to Ho Chi Minh City via Moscow. Our flight from Barcelona to Madrid left 30 minutes late, our layover was only 1 hour and 45 minutes so we were very worried. After landing we have to wait about 25 minutes to get off the plane, we missed our connecting flight.

"  I thought flying Cathay Pacific economy on an ultra long haul flight 3 weeks after returning from a similar distance in J would be a huge disappointment, but life (and CX) holds numerous surprises. Being a Marco Polo Club member allowed me to check in my entire family using the priority lanes on both outbound and return. The advantage was seen in the Manila to Hong Kong route where the check in queues at NAIA 3 seemed to snake around forever. Staff in MNL were courteous enough. Departing MNL through gate 111 was extremely chaotic. I would suggest that one hang around one of the pay-in lounges or in one of the (few) coffee shops outside the gate until the last minute. The MNL-HKG leg was the usual, rushed ultra short flight with absolutely no catering worth mentioning consisting of an overheated pastry, ANZAC cookie and boxed juice drink. PAL serves hot meals on their MNL-HKG flights even in economy, I wonder why a carrier such as CX still continues to think that this budget airline move is worthy of a 5-star airline? Same experience on the return HKG-MNL leg. The long haul product proved to be a pleasant surprise. The seats were more comfortable than expected and the 3-3-3 configuration does a lot for the perception of space in the back cabin. Catering is not CX's strong point, but the meals served were actually edible. The snack option of cup noodles were very tasty and the galley snack tray was always full. In-flight staff were pretty good with ready smiles and service. Good and frequent drink runs were made throughout the 16 hour journey both ways. I would say that it was a pleasant surprise through the long haul leg. I am on the fence regarding the IFE choices, but the hardware is pretty good if you bring your own earphones (the one provided by CX is rubbish).

"  A321 Lisbon to Brussels with TAP Portugal. Flight in economy class. Best sit in 10C (one of the best seats). This is one of the very few aircraft that TAP have with a configuration of a Lufthansa (normal) cabin. And of course guess what? It is a good one. Very nice space for the legs and seats are new. The service is what you can consider a normal, not bad, not good. I did get the same crew the day before on another flight. Some service was the same, today they did have the curtains to separate the classes. So was not a Ryanair flight. Aircraft was half empty, so was a pleasant flight. Of course no WiFi, no magazines, no journals etc. During the flight the crew manager welcomed passengers and Victoria members on the PA system. The funny part was when he said that the Victoria members voted the program one of the best in Europe.

"  I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay.

"I flew Emirates for my first time recently. Having read reviews talking about how great they are and reviews about how cramped their 777 is, I was sceptical. My flight was quite cheap to book ($~650USD). Be warned however, that if you are not flying to or from the US, luggage rules are stricter. If you fly to/from the US, you receive 2 x 20kg bags, otherwise, it is 30kg total. This forced me to spend $350USD on an extra 5kg of luggage, which was quite a hassle. Despite the availability of business class seats, you can only upgrade with points, not cash. The flight was fine, the flight attendants are very sweet and helpful, and the food was some of the best I've had. However - food and drink service takes at least an hour to be delivered, leaving many people finishing their meals before receiving a drink. The seat was pretty standard, I had an empty one next to me, which helped. An inch in each direction would be great. Emirates saved money on the 777 by fitting 10 seats across instead of the usual 9, this leaves very small walkways, and tightens the seats up a bit. However, I'm 6'3"" and didn't have too much trouble. Just be aware, the seats aren't anything to write home about. The ICE entertainment system was good, but a bit jumpy and laggy. Otherwise, ok selection of movies. Unfortunately, my flight didn't have WiFi installed yet. Lastly, the scheduling of the flights seems silly, the Dubai airport is flooded with people at midnight.

I've flown American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta and have never had a flight cancelled in my life. Flew twice with United (once in July, once in August) and both times they've been cancelled. And it's impossible to get anyone on the phone. Safe to say I will be avoiding United for the rest of my life. Two absolutely terrible experiences.",Detractor
"  I really can't understand why this airline is an awarded airline. The service is rushed and unfriendly, and as a premium economy flyer, the only difference between economy seems to be priority boarding and a slightly bigger seat. It is by far the worst premium economy offering I have experienced, with my comparison being Virgin Australia, Virgin Atlantic and Qantas. My flight wasn't bad, just very average. Don't waste your money on premium economy with Cathay Pacific.",Passive

"Several flights over the last couple of months the most recent which was DAL-STL-BWI-LIT-DAL. Online check-in and bag check has been painless crews have been friendly and occasionally even entertaining and all flights have either been on-time if not a little early. Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights. Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point. Also on the most recent DAL-STL leg I got stuck with a B boarding pass despite paying for EarlyBird. Otherwise no real problems at all.",Promoter
"  QF2 back to Sydney from London being the last leg of a Sydney-Singapore-London trip. It is hard to find something to say which means it was a pretty uneventful and steady run with Qantas again. On time departures and arrivals at all ports. F & B was fine, the FA's were great and always nice to hear a reassuring Australian voice at the controls. Two things. One was the flight being completely full. Really packed. Is it time for Qantas to have two London flights from Sydney or possibly to add a Perth flight? Last few times on QF1 & 2 there have been no empty seats. All well and good outsourcing some of the flights to Emirates but will always choose Qantas where possible. Second, Qantas should fit WiFi into the A380 service. EK has it and was good value. Being out of touch for 20 hours whilst flying is not really acceptable these days. These days getting on a Qantas long haul jet means it really does feel like home when stepping on. Check out the safety briefing.

After paying to go premium Economy we did not get any extra service. We had to use the economy toilets quite away back in the plane.

" This is my first time with WOW, when I saw the $500 fare I checked out reviews and thought it looked fine. I don't mind no meal on a flight, not really a fan of airplane food anyway. I thought the connection seemed tight but it was what WOW advertised. So the flight out of Chicago was delayed. No reason was shared, no real info, it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. â€œThey will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the airâ€. Well that was a lie, don't announce things that aren't true. So once we got inside the airport multiple connecting flights were missed so there was a line 30-40 people long with 1 only, 1 WOW employee giving directions. Really WOW, you couldn't do anything to assist all the passengers at that point? So after waiting 20-30 minutes in the line the lady tells me follow the arrivals signs and an agent will be waiting to direct you. Was there an agent, absolutely not. But I did find about 7 other passengers who were on the same connecting flight all wondering around lost wondering what was going on. We were able to piece together some info a few of us received different emails from WOW giving different info. By sharing with each other we realized we could book an airport hotel and they rebooked us on flights the next day. But not one of us had complete info and only by talking to each other could we piece this together. Finally after over an hour someone who worked at the airport, not WOW, got someone from WOW to speak to us and get a bus to take us to the hotel. We were told be ready for a bus to arrive by 3.30am in the morning to take us to the airport. Was there a bus nope, no bus. There were way more WOW stranded passengers at the hotel who arrived after us. The hotel called their shuttle service to come at 4am and take a huge bus full of all the passengers WOW stranded in Iceland and then again at the hotel. Huge thanks to Airport B&B. Now the rebooked flight is delayed, by how much who knows. Will we ever get to Berlin, who knows. Zero trust in WOW and not booking with them again, oh and that $500 fare ended up being $775 with seats and carry-on luggage. So if you care about getting to your destination in a timely manor and communication when things go wrong, I do not recommend WOW.",Detractor

Alitalia is really a budget airline these days - simple food, no inflight entertainment on flights under 4hrs.

" Munich to Vancouver. Business Class Seat 8A on a new A350 is on my opinion is the best seat on this aircraft, the last row of Business Class, with only one row in front of it, and divider to Premium Economy behind. Lots of space, away from galleys and far enough from lavatories. Two things that are inconvenient - the aircraft is extremely noisy and the noise cancelling headphones, attached to seats in Business Class are very bulky and impossible to sleep in. Ear plugs don't help with the noise. I've done this route three times in the past year, and I always choose 8A on MUC - YVR leg. Service is impeccable, food could be hit and miss, entertainment is great and the aircraft is not good, but that's what Lufthansa flies on this route, hence I don't have much choice. There is one more thing - for some reason Business Class on long haul flights seems to be heated to the point of turning into a sauna on a long haul flights, I've noticed that on every flight.

New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights. My expectations were low but I was more than satisfied and I would consider flying with them again.,Promoter

PRG-ARN-TKU TKU-CPH-OSL-PRG in SAS Go within a single weekend. There's nothing to complain about in terms of seat comfort - be it a small 737-600 or an A320 the comfort level is pretty much the same and quite decent at that. The cheapest fare gets you tea or coffee while the snacks for purchase are rather pricey and all in all not that attractive. The ARN-TKU was on a Braathens-operated Saab 200 turboprop. The ride is definitely bumpier but even here the legroom is above standard. The most cramped aircraft by far is the CRJ900 though that's mainly due to the narrow cabin while the seat pitch remains comfortable. My only major issue was the somewhat misleading information by the crew suggesting that people claim their baggage in Stockholm for customs even though it is checked directly to the destination. This made up for 40 minutes of wasted time at ARN. As a whole however I wouldn't hesitate to fly with SAS again.,Passive
" Boston to Denver. My girlfriend and I were seeking to sit next to each other on our flight this morning. Naturally, and understandably, we each had to select a seat and pay to do so. What wasn't natural or understandable was why, for the exact seats, she was billed a higher price. We tried this on multiple days and seats. See the attached photos. I don't know if it was because she was female, or had been on the website before, or fit whatever weird algorithm Frontier uses to upcharge people. But it was clearly not right. So I called customer service. Not the poor representative's fault by any means, but her utter lack of English comprehension was not helpful, and it took 20min of her jumbling up words before I requested to speak with a manager. When I spoke with the manager, he told me that his system had it much more expensive, so we were getting a good deal regardless. Which was incredibly dismissive. As I saw it was getting us nowhere and this was something beyond his pay grade, I asked to be transferred to the survey so I could express these concerns. Instead, he hung up on us. I fly Frontier a lot for their cheap flights, but with multiple delays over my last few flights (which is usually not even announced until the last minute), poor customer service, no complimentary cups of water on board (odd way to save a buck), and more, I'll be spending the same money for Spirit and/or other airlines.",Detractor
"  Shanghai to Beijing. Chose this airline as it was cheaper and the timing gave me half a day more in Shanghai before moving on to Beijing. The aircraft type stated during booking was a Boeing 787-9, however, they changed this a few days before the flight to an A330. Luckily I had a point to check my flight booking consistently, as the seat that I selected (33A) was a premium economy seat on the 787, but an economy class seat on the A330- managed to move to seat 32A, which was a premium economy seat. The seat itself was identical to the economy class seat, with the exception of a different colour and generous legroom - I could stretch my legs fully without even touching the seat back in front of me! Before take-off, the cabin crew served drinks to the passengers in premium economy - a welcome service, but perhaps the standard of a premium economy class cabin, given that this was my first time flying premium economy. The flight was delayed-the boarding time was supposed to be 5:25pm, but the aircraft did not even come in until about 5:35pm! In the end, we landed in Beijing 30 minutes late. The cabin crew were quite friendly, giving out drinks quickly and clearing them fast enough. A meal was served on board, but I found it to be rather small compared to other full service carriers. The IFE screen, though touchscreen, was a bit small and the selection was quite limited. However, what I really found weird was the ban on all electronic devices - being used to being able to use smaller PEDs (with communication features turned off, of course) on other airlines, this was a surprise to me. Overall I found this flight to be enjoyable and given the fare, would choose them again.",Passive

At this stage, I called Eurowings help desk back, and stuck them on the phone with the Lufthansa employee. After the Eurowings employee was slightly understanding of why Lufthansa couldnt fix their problem, I was sent to Eurowings counter where everyone was camped out on the floor with no answers.

This is is the second review I've left in the last four hours because I have very little to do since arriving in Newark. Delayed flights. Terrible customer service. Save yourself the headache. Every single time I don't fly Southwest, I regret it. Do not make mistake I have made.",Detractor
" Washington to Denver. Horrific. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Frontier cancelled my flight because of its own equipment failure. I am having to return home by booking through another airline in order to get home today ( my original arrival date), my only other option to not spend extra money was to return 3-4 days from now. Spent 40 min on the phone to find out now refund. I will not be spending more money than I would have if I flew a decent airline. Would not wish this experience on my worst enemy.",Detractor
I flew from Brussels to Bodrum and back in September 2014. Both flights had a delay of 1 hour. Staff were not very helpful nor friendly. Seats are very small and not comfortable (worn out I think). Landing was not enjoyable either: not smooth.,Detractor
" London to Washington. Apart from the space, nothing nothing was First class, not even the comfort. Crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach. Food which used to be fantastic is just eatable, no more. Wines which were the best in the sky when Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson made the selection (apart from a good white champagne, but mediocre rosÃ©) are at the level of a business class. And my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me. And an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing. Needless to say no wifi! Apart from their LHR First and Concorde Room lounges at LHR which remain great, BA is now no better than a 3 star airline. Sad for the clients and shameful for BA management.",Detractor
CX101 25 May HKG-SYD Airbus 330 Seat 60C. 4 cabin crew members for the whole economy aisle working in pairs. Heavy rain rocky climb so service started later than usual. Crew members working in pairs efficient co- ordinated yet courteous. In the 2nd meal service passengers asleep were woken up gently so as to revert seat back for passengers behind them to eat. Only 5 toilets for the whole economy section. Food of course meagre it is economy class. Seat pitch acceptable. Enjoyable flight. All needs catered for. Due to it being an overnight flight did not try the IFE opted for some sleep instead. Noticed there was no overhead air flow outlet control cabin temperature acceptable.,Promoter
"  Beijing to Hong Kong. I had such a terrible experience, in that my colleague's gender was listed wrong on her ticket. She's a female, and somehow booking through the agent her gender was listed as male. Air China refused to correct this, and made us cancel the ticket (and pay the cancellation fee) and also purchase a more expensive ticket. Never before have I been so disgusted by incapable customer service representatives who just pass the buck. It was a really soul crushing experience.",Detractor
We flew MEL-LAX return in Business Premier on 3rd Dec returning 19th Jan. Although our 5th trip with Air NZ this was our first time travelling Business. I was impressed from the moment we were on the plane we were warmly greeted by the hostess and whilst getting settled were offered a pre-take off drink whilst the other passengers were boarding. At this time they also take an order for your pre-dinner drink to be served once cruising altitude is reached. Drinks and Food came out promptly and was of a high quality impressed that we were not presented with standard airline food. The lie flat beds were comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep on the long flight and definitely worth the extra money we spent. Entertainment system provided plenty of choice to suit a range of tastes making the trip going very fast. We had the same positive experience on our flight home and cannot praise Air NZ enough for such an enjoyable journey.,Promoter
"  New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta. I experienced a Europe-US flight with Delta last year on A KLM ticket which was a good one. I would definitely consider flying with Delta again if the ticket price is competitive.",Promoter
"I flew Thai Airways from Bangkok to Krabi on on a cramped A320 aircraft. These A320 planes are new but they are obviously configured for secondary short haul route. I found out in the seatmap that they have more seat than Thai Smiles A320. Not really happy with seat comfort offered. Other that that, they are fine. Great staff, enjoyable snackbox with a round each of tea, coffee, softdrinks. Punctuality is perfect.",Promoter
"Great word of caution. AC flight may be ""Rouged"" in whole or on connections. AC regular deserve from my experience as an Elite flyer their four stars. Notable AC improvements in customer care on-time efficiency crew attitude and wine selection in business. Rouge is another issue entirely. Take away 4 inches of seat pitch remove IFE seat back TV put you on seats that are ultra thin and hurt you take a 3 by 3 narrow seat and put a pillow in the middle seat and call it Premium. Use underpaid Disney trained staff who wear odd hats smile and try to put their best foot forward but are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers on the plane fighting for overhead bin space and how crowded and unhappy they and you have Rouge. For us it was like travelling in a nice comfy car on one leg and then being put on a cattle truck for the next and for the same price! Never been so comfortable on one or felt so tricked on the next. Maybe we should bring our own iPads and a nice folding chair? Since this was an Air Canada ticket you are forced to share it with Rouge (look on-line Rouge has either subsumed all flights on some routes or is interleaved on others). For this review all stars have been cut in half because of our Rouge experience. Mixing the two is airlines is comparing ""chalk and cheese"" and confounds the star ratings.",Detractor

This is our 3rd trip with Sunwing in the last 4 years and we have not had any complains in the past. The service provided this time was quiet unacceptable especially at the beginning of a vacation that we paid a lot of money for. Still waiting for a ""Sunwing Cares"" rep to contact me.

Flew economy London - Abu Dhabi - Male return previously always flow Emirates however this fare was Â£500 cheaper in the sale so thought we would try them. The two flights on the larger planes in and out of London were awful no leg room and as other people say when you recline your seat the base goes forward leaving you with no leg room. Even my 9 year old was not comfy the seats are hard and narrow. The flights from Abu Dhabi to Male were better more room bigger seats however toilets are at back next to galley so a nightmare squashing in and out. Food on all sectors was disappointing given a brown paper bag with a sandwich. Had run out of our choice on one leg. Found staff in general to be very abrupt. Also one drinks service coming into London. I also don't like that when I asked for a gin and tonic they mix it themselves instead of giving you the mini bottles so you have no idea how much they have put in. Thought the entertainment was okay but nothing amazing. Apart from the minimal leg room the worst part was being stuck for 3 hrs in Abu Dhabi airport. It is small with very limited eating areas Abu Dhabi to male we didn't even have seating at the gate everyone was on the floor then straight on. Queues for transit both ways were horrendous and badly organised we were in the end taken through the business express lane. If you are used to Dubai airport I don't recommend it. I wish we had spent the Â£500 more and flown Emirates. Will never fly again with Etihad.,Detractor
"  Kolkata to New York via Hong Kong. Efficient and friendly cabin crew. Good selection of drinks and snacks in between meals. Herring bone seating layout offered superb privacy. A fine collection of films to view including Hollywood classics (e.g., Casablanca) and very recent releases (e.g., La La Land). Would have liked some classics of Asian cinema by directors such as Kurosawa and Ray. The bathrooms were kept clean on the 15+ hour flight and the flatbed seat allowed for some good napping.

The cabin crew are friendly and very attentive. The seats in business class are arranged in 2x2x2, which offer a good range of adjustment for different seating positions, as well as full flat bed. PTV screen size and brightness are adequate, providing a wide variety of movies. The only downside is the food. Even though the boarding drinks are offered after boarding and nicely served on an individual tray with a selection of nuts or chocolates, the main dishes are to a little bit tedious. Fortunately, they offer a well-chosen wine list. China Southern Airlines customer service and English skills seem to have improved a lot in recent years and continue to progress.",Promoter
" Colombo to London via Bahrain. I had a really appalling experience with Gulf Air. Having had a text confirmation of the flight, it was then delayed 4 hours (with no text informing me of this, which would have saved me going to the airport). Upon returning to the airport at 1100pm on New Year's eve, I was told the flight was cancelled. There was no business Check in, so wth two kids I had to wait in a long queue of irate passengers. They were massively under-staffed, and were unable to find me any alternative flight to London, so I booked my own - on Qatar Airways (a great airline) - it took my a whole 3 minutes to find this flight, but Gulf air were unable to do anything! Despite writing three times to Gulf, including one email to the mis-titled, 'director of communications', I had no apology or indeed any reply whatsoever from them. Eventually through my on line travel agency I got a note saying that I would be reimbursed for my flight within 30 Days. It is all a bit of a joke, my last minute tickets on Qatar Airways cost me an additional Â£3,000. So if this is how they treat their Business Class customers, imagine what it's like in Economy. I seriously recommend never using Gulf - there is a massive Gulf between what they promise and what they deliver!",Detractor
"Leg from SYD to Singapore was a codeshare flight with Qantas. Excellent service, great choice of movies, food good. Flight arrived early which made connection easier considering 15 min walk to gate. Had booked economy plus on Finnair leg. What a joke, don't book seats 22c,d,e or f you have an offset screen due to only being three seats in row in front. Screens were in two end seats of row in front which meant you were viewing at an angle if in two middle seats. End seats both had pull up screens which meant that because of the need to angle screen it was shining in my eyes which was very annoying when trying to sleep on the 12 hour flight. My screen kept shutting down every couple of minutes so I gave up. Staff were pleasant but overall the seats were uncomfortable, I should have saved my money and not gone economy plus.

"  Flew United Airlines round-trip between Orange County - San Francisco during 4th of July weekend. Flight from Orange County was delayed, but the automated text messages by United on my phone kept me updated. Boarding on ERJ-175 was done from a gate that did not use the Jet Bridge. The jet-engine noise inside ERJ-175 cabin was significantly louder than what I am used to on other domestic flights, but thankfully, it was a short one hour flight.

When it comes to redeeming credited vouchers? Even though I have a $50 credit but after trying to use it the credit comes to $8.24 even though my base fare is over $80. Called their customer support and got told that basically even though the credit is for $50 it may not exactly be $50.

"I didn't really know what to expect from this flight, it had been a couple of years since my last BA flight (Gatwick to Nice in that case) we were on our way to Lyon Airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed London. Upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. With little information given as to why. When we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for himself. What amused me was that the captain came on over the PA and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. Safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. The captain kept us informed as best he could, the cabin crew showed no effort at all. They showed no will to actually be there, they didn't check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39Â°C outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. Once we took off the service seemed rushed, I wasn't able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back, no so much a pitiful Ham and Cheese bun thing and a drink. There was no personal touch to it. As we were approaching Heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley (we were in the back row) was the two crew complaining about their hours. I'm flying with BA Citiflyer to Dublin in September, if the service hasn't improved I'll think twice if I really need to travel BA again.",Detractor

Completely disorganized unfriendly and the least bit helpful. The customer service from the second I came into the airport in Toronto were so unwelcoming. After printing out my boarding passes at the kiosk with no help (Sunwing kiosks had assistants walking around assisting people) struggled with a kiosk and then headed to the line to check bags in. The girl at the desk just seemed so unimpressed and was very cold towards my family and I. Upon going through customs it was very disorganized and very little help was offered while at the receipt kiosks. While going through baggage check the man checking our carry ons was telling everyone that passed that our flight was cancelled. Mind you the smartphone app said the flight was on time early actually. We then got into the waiting area there was just a sense of panic going on and nobody knew what was going on. A flight attendant came and confirmed it was cancelled. Maybe 10 minutes went by and another flight attendant came by and said it was in fact running on time and not to worry. All in all very disorganized and unwelcoming. I've always flown with Sunwing and I guess next time I won't be travelling with United.,Detractor

The only real negative was the sparseness of alcoholic beverages. There was no white wine and very little red wine or beer. On the return trip, since we had a 9 hour layover, the airline provided our group with a room in Shanghai at the Lihao Hotel. It is one of the worst hotels I have every stayed.

The stewardesses wore a scowl most of the time other than exiting, and they ran out of western food choices by mid plane where we sat on both legs, leaving chinese pudding for breakfast and seafood with noodles or chicken and seafood with rice (the western choice ) for dinner. If you can't tolerate seafood then bring your own. They also broke the wheel off one of our suitcases and took a portable phone charger and all lighters at the airport.

My only real problem was flying back, the ignorant middle aged male passenger directly in front of me, immediately reclined his seat after take off, although there is very little room. I am 5 ft 10, and have limited mobility and so was very uncomfortable for 5 and a half hours.

Went from JFK to CDG and back in premium economy. Sky priority allowed us to check in and get through security very quickly. We took advantage of the business class lounge (paid about $50 per person) and thought it was well worth it for the food wine and quiet. The premium economy seats although roomier than economy were nowhere near business class standards so do not expect to get a comfortable night's sleep. I did appreciate the extra legroom and the fixed shell design as this made it feel quite spacious.

The legroom really made my journey difficult from Frankfurt to Delhi. Holding a toddler on the flight is not a good idea because seats are not that wide. My tired toddler made me stand through out the flight. While returning (Delhi-Frankfurt), again service was poor, whereas it was nice from Frankfurt to Dallas. Is this limited service common for south asian flights. Flights are usually full, so there is a little chance to change seats. Air-conditioning in flight can give you a hard time and square cut blankets will not help you, better carry your own 1 light weight blanket and cap/hat and socks. If you are a non-veg then you have some meal options but for veg folks, you will get limited option and they missed my veg meal and I could not settle for sea food. $1400 flight and this kind of service.",Detractor
I flew from Barbados to Toronto on AC Rouge and I saw red. I didn't notice when I booked the flight that this was AC Rouge. The seats are very uncomfortable limited leg room and crammed. No audio no USB or electrical plug. I don't have and IPhone or IPad to download the AC Rouge Apps to see movie or listen to tunes therefore I read Enroute. This was the worst flight ever! Flying 6 hours sitting on those seats killed my back and I was bored. For extra cash I will be flying West Jet. AC Rouge would be fine for short flights EG: Ottawa â€“ Toronto. AC lost my business!,Detractor
"  Ho Chi Minh City to Los Angeles via Hong Kong. First time flying with Cathay and I love this airline. The seat is really comfortable for a long flight. Good food, good movies for entertainment. Cabin crew are nice and friendly. For my inbound flight from LAX to SGN, I cannot self check-in due to some technical issue and their staffs are willing to help. Only one thing I want to complain about this flight is the crying children around me. I know no one can control crying children but I think cabin crew should do something so other passengers don't feel annoyed.",Promoter

Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth Â£70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!,Promoter
" I took a business class trip from Beijing to London, and the service was not as good as previous trips. The crew greeted me in a pleasant manner, and presented me with welcome drinks etc. However, when one female crew member took my dinner order, she forgot to ask for drink choices, and it also applied to the person next to me. None of us had any drinks with our meal and it was in biz class. My pre-booked special meal did not turn up until I asked either. Their procedure was to check with special meal requests then serve, but this was not done correctly. My friend asked me to complain onboard, I didn't think that particular member of staff was worth of complaining. It's the natural ability to serve and to do a good job that she is lacking. Other than that the flight in biz class was comfortable enough, the drinks were plenty.",Passive
"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch. Clearly Turkish have the right idea they just need to standardise their product.",Passive
"  New York to Milan. Really pleasant flight on Alitalia, the in flight Business product is above par. Their lounge in NYC urgently needs a facelift, it looks like being thrown back to the 90s and this impacts the overall image that the airline is trying to build. Boarding was average, only one door used on the 330 to let everyone in so although priority boarding is enforced if you don't arrive immediately then it feels like ""everyone in"".

Montreal to Athens and returned Athens to Toronto. The airfare was the same as my Air Canada flight to Athens the year previous so there was definitely no savings.

"  This was our first experience with Icelandair and Iceland Airport and we intend it to be our last. We flew round trip from Boston to Glasgow with a layover at Keflavik Airport both ways. Flights into Iceland both ways were on time, but from Keflavik out, both were significantly late, 4+ hours going to Glasgow and 1+ hours going to Boston. In both cases, Icelandair or anyone at the airport for that matter didn't seem concerned, almost like it was standard procedure. Everyone was really nice but immensely inefficient.

"I decided to travel with Wizz due to their decent hours, considering other flights would take longer to fly from Abu Dhabi to Norway. I had never flown Wizz, and never will again. Their information and ticketing says that they allow one small carry-on piece and a personal item. Upon arriving at the airport it becomes a matter of or rather than and. Suddenly, strict rules and regulations apply and a fee of 190 aed ($52) is tagged on. Their definition of ""small bag"" is the size of a woman's purse according to the person at the counter. Furthermore, trying to argue about the size stated on the ticket and the counter person's definition is pointless as there is no manager available to verify the size. Again, most positions are not manned by people who can make one decision, instead they're only there to follow some ominous rules that I'm willing to bet they don't even know themselves. Airlines like Wizz prey on the blurred lines between miscommunication and misleading so to avoid that, follow their rules as many others have suggested. Better yet, I would suggest not to fly them at all. At face value the ticket price seems great, but quite frankly it's only a small percentage off of the price bigger carriers charge. In addition, Wizz flies out of DWC - an airport between Dubai and Abu Dhabi - for which a cab ride is 200 AED ($54). So, add the base fare, a small hand bag and a cab fare, and Qatar, Etihad and other local international carriers sound like bargain themselves.",Detractor
LHR-PEK-LHR. We travel BA club world often and my overall impression is very good. Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable. And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin. And if the flight is not full is so much better than the claustrophobic upper deck. Strongly recommended for a discounted ticket.,Promoter
Flew 6 flights recently in business with Emirates. All on 777 and A380. All flights on time Glasgow to Dubai then to Bangkok to Sydney Melbourne to Singapore then to Dubai and back to Glasgow. Every car arrived on time check in a breeze as was passport control with special pass. Made travelling a pleasure. All personnel were fantastic kind and attentive. Food great as was wine and in every detail Emirates are way beyond the competition. Have read some other reviews which are rather negative.

Airbus 380 LHR-DXB and return. Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine. So much better than BA but some way to go to match Qatar. Airbus 340 DXB-COK and return. Older than 380 but more room so more comfortable.,Promoter
"  Having flown on many different airlines whilst travelling over the years, my family and I decided to opt for a little more comfort while taking an overnight flight from Sacramento to Newark via O'Hare. It turned out that economy plus on United Airlines is a scam to make you pay more money for very little else. We ended up having to pay for checking in bags, the seats were uncomfortable and the added 'leg room' was laughable. I had some box under the seat in front of me that meant i had to move my feet to the left for the flight, very uncomfortable. Staff on the flight were not interested in the economy plus / economy cattle behind the curtain and I was told a flat no when i asked if they had a spare blanket for my son who was freezing.

LAX-JFK return. Virgin America straddles a weird and fairly confusing space between full- service and budget but is surely the most innovative airline in the US. So many simple touches - playing music at check-in captain farewelling passengers and explaining delays at the boarding gate instead of check-in staff ordering food from seat-back screen. The legroom is fine by domestic standards but would be tight internationally. My flight over was without incident but the flight back was cancelled. This is where Virgin America completely fell apart. They could not handle the mess of 180 angry passengers trying to get out of New York. Despite sprinting back to the check-in desk it took them 3 hours to get me a hotel and food voucher and they couldn't tell me when I could fly next but said they would call. They never did and it was up to me to contact them to try and get to LAX. There was no communication - we were not told the ticketing system was down - to us it appeared that they were just incredibly slow taking an hour to process each passenger. The airport hotel was excellent and they were able to get me to LAX via SFO less than 24 hours later.,Passive
" Guangzhou to Los Angeles. Travelling with my wife Furnari from Sydney to LA, but we chose to transfer in Hong Kong, stayed for one day, and then caught our long flight to LA in Guangzhou. I found it was the best way to get tickets at the most reasonable price. We just landed in LA couple hours ago, and I just want to show my appreciation for all the crew members who helped us during the past 12 hours. At first, I found out my seat was broken and there was a huge empty part on my lower seatback. I asked a flight attendant to get me a big pillow to block it. He came out with a better solution by offering us three joint seats. That was very nice of him. Secondly, we forgot to apply for the special meals. We bought some vegan food before leaving Sydney, but we finished them all in Hong Kong. I told the crew I was wondering if they can gave us some vegan food, and she told me they had some extra vegan and vegetarian meals today, lucky us, we can have some. We are so grateful for their great kindness and professionality. Despite the shortage of the hardware, they really have amazing service skills.

"We flew Athens to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Athens to Abu Dhabi was great, smooth check in and we were given the emergency exit row seats. The meals were tasty. We had an 8 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi and was not happy with the service there. Before we had gotten on the plane they searched our bags and made us throw all liquid out (even though we had already done this in customs). This meant entering the flight without anything to drink. For a 14 hour flight I like to stay hydrated so this was extremely frustrating. After take off I asked for a bottle of water. I was told I couldn't have one, I could only have a plastic cup that they filled a quarter of the way with water. Apart from our drinks with meals this was all we got. I rang the service bell and waited 1/2 an hour and got no reply even after pressing twice. I had to walk down the other end of the plane just to get another tiny cup of water. For 14 hours on a plane this is ridiculous and for the amount of money you pay for a ticket I would think you could at least be given adequate amounts of water. The flight went smoothly, although meals were rushed towards the end of the flight (don't know why though we had 14 hours to prepare for them) it was a fine, yet uncomfortable journey.",Passive

Why does Easyjet humiliate women at the gate - making them put their handbags into their already small cabin bags yet allow anyone with duty free bags to take these on board as well as their cabin bag allowance. There is no consistency in this requirement and until you arrive at the gate no clear advice. So you seat on an aircraft with no money to buy refreshments no accessible passport and none of the other items that make a flight more bearable. It is humiliating to have your boarding pass confiscated while you struggle to put your handbag (even a small one) into an already full very small cabin bag while other people sail past you with their duty free bottles of wine clanging merrily away. The bullying tactics used at the gate will make me think twice about flying with easyjet again. Please make clear what is required and be consistent.,Passive
Took an Airbus 330 SIN-KIX on 29 June 2014. Flight departed and arrived on time. Service was average - good but not excellent. Perhaps it has to do with the full load. Aircraft was alternating between very cold and very hot throughout the flight. Restrooms were clean IFE working perfectly and food was standard. The major flaw was the seat pitch.

"I have been a long time fan of Emirates from the 90's, when they provided enough competition to make flying more humane from the antipodes. More recently though I have been less than satisfied with their service levels and customer service, this has accelerated since the ""merger"" of routes with Qantas. This flight was not so pleasant - the flight was delayed from Gatwick due to an oil spill and impacted the whole journey. The inflight service was generally good, food okay, the A380 seats are in the top quartile at the price point for comfort and pitch, I was comfortable on the A380 for the whole journey despite being a tall Aussie. I even snagged some good seats near the bulkhead which made legroom no problem. The 777 segment from Dubai to Melbourne (via Malaysia) was not pleasant. The planes are older, tired, have narrower seats and I was uncomfortable the whole journey. Try and avoid any Emirates segments that use this older equipment, it generally sours your experience of Emirates. The main problems I had with this journey was the late departure. The 4 hour delay caused me to miss my booked connection, and I was put onto the dog-leg segment via Malaysia. Emirates have refused any form of compensation in breach of European rules and refused to supply any assistance at the journey end for this delay.

I have flown Ryanair many times over the last few years and never really had a bad experience though it was clear they were pushing the low cost model to extremes. My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes. Ryanair finally seems to be aware of what attracts customers apart from low fares and is addressing some of the issues I hope it continues.,Passive
"The fares are cheap but it's like paying to be tortured seats extremely cramped. They will not allow you to put anything under the seat in front of you so your purse is your carry-on and they'll charge you to check what should be your carry-on bag. Most European rollers are smaller than U.S. ones so your roller won't work. Our first flight from Brussels to Berlin cost us 50 euros extra when they took my roller at the gate. My husbands roller was allowed. On the second easy jet flight from Berlin to Paris we paid the counter charge of 30 euro for my roller only to have my husbands roller denied at the security line adjacent (literally) to the ticket counter for which we paid another gate fee of 50 euro even though we hadn't left the lobby. While in the security line a woman on our flight was worried about the time. She said ""I know this airline and if you're not at the gate a half hour before departure they will deny you boarding"". So we begged ourselves to the front of the line and ran to the gate. At least in Brussels they were calling people up on a flight that was next to depart. If you are under 25 and making a short trip then take easy jet. If you are an American on an extensive trip avoid them. What you save in air fare is not worth the fees you will pay at the airport.

Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats.

I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security).

NRT-CDG Business cabin. Up to ANA standards when it comes to FA politeness and devotion to passenger service. Plane (B747) was very clean including the toilets throughout the flight. Seat was angled-flat but adequate to sleep. Inflight entertainment (VOD) was exhaustive in its offering (even though the channel guide catalog is somewhat hard to understand). Food was nice but odd in terms of offering. Appetizer and main course were delicious even though portions were slightly small.

" I always have mixed feelings about Delta's 767-300ER. It (and 767 in general) has the best economy seating arrangement of 2-3-2. However, the aircraft is loud and the overhead bins are small. IFE on this particular aircraft was good, with a nice selection of movies (this has been my positive impression about Delta). Food and service were decent, as expected from the airline. My flight was diverted due to bad weather in NYC (sounds familiar?), and this, of course, was not the airline's fault. In fact, the crew did a good job updating us about status and showed effort to get us to JFK as fast as they could.",Promoter

SIN-NKG-TAO MU772 A320 in economy. Takeoff was 30 minutes after scheduled time. No explanation by the crew. Legroom was ok made this midnight flight fairly comfortable. My seat did not have a blanket and pillow and I had to ask for a set. The seat itself was in very good shape other than a loose tray table which was a problem for a lot of people. No TV screens safety procedure was shown to us by the cabin crew. No PTVs something frequent flyers of MU should be used to. Food was nothing out of the ordinary some yoghurt sour cucumber salad fresh fruits and a choice of western or oriental breakfast. Both were OK. Many rounds of beverage services and alcohol readily available. Cabin crew were very friendly though reserved other than a male steward who was very impatient. Not worth the ticket price for such an ordinary airline.,Passive
I've flown 8 times with Frontier airlines and I couldn't be happier with their service. The flights were laid back and quiet. Once I even lost my boarding pass after I went through the security checkpoint. The lady at the terminal was very nice understanding and knowledgeable. After verifying my identity with a few clicks at a computer she printed me out another pass and I was able to catch my flight without a problem. They've never lost any of my luggage either. The inflight crew were always very nice and quick to respond to questions and concerns. The only down-side I could find is that you can only buy in-flight refreshment with a credit card - no cash.,Promoter
DXB-JFK on the A380. Boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seats were comfortable but worn out. No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.,Passive
" On 8/13/2018, I flew from Oakland to Baltimore Washington non-stop. Received an E-mail informing me that I could do check-in now the day before, Didn't let me after entering last name and conformation no. Tried the day of my departure, still no luck, same thing happened at the Kiosk in the airport. A worker came over and directed me to the desk, where my boarding pass and baggage was completed. When I finally boarded, I noticed that the seat that was assigned to me was a middle seat, with arm rest that couldn't be lifted. I beckoned the attendant over and informed her that I was not comfortable, I suffer with arthritis, sciatica nerve pain, and asked if she could ask if someone could switch seats with me, she informed me that we had a full flight and walked away. Not only was my seat uncomfortable, but my legs were up against the seat in front of me. By the time I got off the plane, I was in deep pain and could hardly walk.

"Flew London Heathrow to Barcelona. Ungracious, unsmiling and unfriendly crew, should have chosen better. On boarding, not so much as a grin, less so a smile from the crew. Ridiculously tight seat pitch saw legs spilling into the aisle every few feet (pardon the pun). My husband took a photo to send to a friend illustrating how far back we were (way back) which happened to show the back of a stewardess in the distance. Another member of the crew told her and she got quite stroppy. Her: You can't take photos. Husband: Why? Her: Because I said. Mr Chief misery crew then turns up and demands that the photo (showing someone's back) is deleted, pointing to the security card as if there were some stated rule in it. There wasn't. Deleted photo anyway, Mr Chief misery crew then takes phone to delete said photo from the trash box. Talk about an over reaction. Mr Chief misery crew then berates another passenger, no Bluetooth headphones allowed! Another passenger (third row from back) approaches crew member because they weren't asked if they wanted drinks. Crew: Maybe somebody else will come and serve you drinks. They didn't. Passenger presses call button and asked for a drink (after explaining the situation). Crew member: No, it's too late! (Before complaining, in Spanish, and laughing with other crew). Seat belt light on for the duration of the flight, presumably to keep passengers from bothering staff. Captain made tannoy at end of flight (because he'd forgotten to earlier?) to say which route we'd flown. Staff who hate working with the public shouldn't.

Understandable that unpredictable situations occur, but the way the airline company treated us was awful leaving us waiting on the plane for 7 hours without any water.

Most passengers in my vicinity were surprised as other airlines charge for this from North America, even long haul. Food was tasty - fish, chicken or beef. Snack mid flight and hot breakfast - chive omlette or maple waffles - prior to landing. Flight crew were professional and friendly, well dressed and attentive.

Business Class LHR-Alicante-Madrid. Do not consider 3 seats being used for 2 people as Business Class. Very good BC lounge. Unable to check in online for return journey. At Madrid again used the lounge and did some shopping. Our boarding cards which show priority and clearly seating in BC shows boarding ends 10 minutes before departure. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes before departure and were told the gate had closed and we would not be allowed to board. Had a very officious supervisor who was not going to budge and insisted the gate closed 15 minutes before departure. She would not agree with what was printed on our boarding card and said that it was wrong. Eventually someone must have said something sensible to her because she finally caved in and allowed us to board. She would not however stop arguing - even when we were walking down the finger to get on the aircraft. To add insult to injury we sat on the aircraft for 10 minutes before 2 female passengers with a child boarded and went through to the economy area. Priority on our boarding card was obviously lost on that member of staff.,Passive

" Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. First time on Air Canada rouge, and based on the reviews was expecting the worst when in reality it was about on par with Air Canada. Same menu, same service. although the attendants seemed more like servers at a Kelseys rather than professional flight crew. Had my own iPad and did find a couple of movies to watch. The flight departed and arrived on time as did my luggage so no complaints there either. I missed the moving map and there was no communication from the flight deck until the descent. The seats really weren't an issue until the person in front reclined theirs, I'm only 5""6 and their seat was jammed against my knees. The person refused to straighten the seat back so I could get out to use the washroom. had to squeeze out over the armrest.

" London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.",Promoter

The bar counter at the back of the Business cabin was left depleted and dirty, not once in over 4 hours did the crew check on passengers and enquire about drinks. Only during the last hour or so did they reappear to offer, unenthusiastically, drinks or snacks.

We took a flight from Manchester to Toronto on the B767. After reading the reviews on here before I left I expected the worst. I am over 6 ft tall and so asked at check in whether they had any extra leg room seats available. They did and I was placed there free of charge. Once on board I found the seat was a bulkhead by an emergency exit so although I couldn't stretch my legs straight there was more space than other seats. My friends hadn't requested extra legroom so we're sat further back in the plane. I went and joined them for a small time (plane was half empty) and the space was no where near as bad as made out on here. Ok space is tight but the cabin felt open and refreshed. Food and service was ok but felt they were a bit stingy with the drinks (only serve soft drinks and only brought round twice) plus no water served in between. Having said all of this I wouldn't like to fly on here should it be a full flight so would try not to use them again unless it was the only option.,Passive
" I was supposed to be flying from Tokyo to Hanoi via a transit flight through Beijing. The two flights was supposed to be 9 hours maximum, but due to a 40 minutes delay of the first flight, a lot of other customers and myself missed our transit. Even though the ground staff in Haneda airport assured me that I would meet my flight, I suddenly found myself freezing and stranded in the unknown land of Beijing for 9 hours, waiting for the next flight. To make matters worse, it was not to my intended destination. I had to take a flight to Seoul, waited there for another 4 hours, before flying another airline from Seoul to Hanoi. To sum it up, I wasted 26 hours of my time travelling whereas I should only have spent 9. The airline did not bother setting up accommodation for any of the guests, offering only a meagre amount of 200 yuan (less than 30 dollars) as â€œcompensationâ€, which, realistically speaking, is nowhere near enough for a hotel room. The staff were rather unhelpful and unprofessional. As far as I am concerned, I did not receive any apologies throughout the whole ordeal. The only â€œexplanationâ€ given was that â€œMore than 20000 other guests are also in the same situationâ€. This â€œexplanationâ€ to me sounds more like an admission of inefficiency on their part than anything really. My luggage, which was stuck in Beijing, was handled without an ounce of care. It was just put randomly in front of the Air China office with no one to look after and could have been easily stolen. The ground staff were extremely unfriendly and unprofessional. When I came to the Air China luggage office, despite the fact that there were 3 staff members on duty, they did not respond to my questions despite my repeated gesturing, preferring to chat among themselves instead. Overall, I had an extremely unsatisfying experience with ChinaAir and will not ever use this service again. I do NOT recommend this airline to anyone.",Detractor

BRU-BKK on B777-200 and BKK-FRA on AB346. Seats on both planes are the semi lie flat type most of the other Asian carriers exchanged in favour of full lie flat seats. I don't understand why TG can't have fully lie flat seating on near 12 hour flights. It is difficult to sleep in the current seats. IFE was somewhat slow but there was a decent inventory of films. A nice touch was the loaded menu for the flight as I didn't get a menu on my return flight. Outgoing flight service was somewhat poor with the FAs not too interested in the pax. Return flight had FAs present in the cabin. On both flights despite there supposedly being a selection of white wines there was one white wine option only. Outgoing 1st meal was overcooked bland and poorly presented. The 2nd meal was equally unpleasant. Return flight 1st meal was up to TG's former reputation but the 2nd meal option consisted of some greasy pork sausages on cabbage with boiled potato. It looked like someone had run down to the 7-11 and bought some of those hot dogs that are a mainstay of Thailand 7-11s. Seriously sausages as a meal in business class? The other option was duck. Gate staff in Brussels are contracted out and they were rather unpleasant. Bangkok TG check-in and gate experience was excellent. Baggage service on inbound flight was slow and rather poor However bags were delivered promptly in FRA. It's sad to see an airline that had once set the standard for service and F&B deteriorate. I hope that TG can set itself straight.,Passive
"  China Southern Airlines from Guangzhou to Sydney, and a great airline and terrific staff.

" Oklahoma City to Tampa. It is very frustrating that the majority of flyers take on 2 and even 3 carry on items. Most of them are large and need to be checked. We check our bags everytime we fly and are charged 25 bucks per bag. But, the people that don't check their bags and are forced to check them at the plane don't get charged a dime. There was a girl on our flight 3 days ago that carried on a duffle bag that was bigger than her. It didn't fit in the overhead compartment and it didn't fit under her seat. She had her feet on top of it the entire flight and no one said anything to her. All of this ""not checking bags"" also holds up the entire plane and with short connection times we have made very close calls of almost missing our connecting flights. This is a very frustrating and unfair system that needs to be taken care of immediately.",Detractor
"CDG-KL travelled long haul with Air France for the first time. Had heard that the Premium Economy seats were uncomfortable but that turned out to be an understatement. They were as hard as park benches. I had to resort to scrounging cushions from other seats to sit on - not worth the price premium. Leg room was OK and could extend my legs fully under seat in front (I'm 62""). The food was OK but the service appalling. No attempt was made to deliver an aperitif before the food but rather had to be requested at the same time. Took a good 45 minutes for them to come and clear away the plates with all the attendant issues of having it left there on the tray. No offers of digestif despite being listed on the menu. During the cabin darkness period was not approached a single time to be offered a drink hot flannel etc. The only time I saw crew during this time was when I got up to walk front to back of the plane and discovered a couple of them in the galley reading magazines. All in all doesn't come anywhere near Emirates or Singapore so would actively look to avoid in future for long haul.",Passive
On April 26 checked in for a flight from Toronto to Puerto Plata. The check in agent was not friendly and very direct. She stated that my mother could not check in with us however did not indicate why. I informed her we were all on the same booking and that my mother did not speak fluent English. Our seats were selected for us without asking us where we would like to sit (fwd mid aft). When I booked the flight I was informed that my 2 year old daughter would receive a child's meal and a kids backpack with activities. I was informed on the outbound flight that there were no child's meals for my daughter and that her only option was the cheese pizza that is offered to all passengers. My daughter at no time was offered the Kids backpack. On May 3 Puerto Plata to Toronto the check in process was a mess there was no order and it took forever to check in. As inbound special meals were being offered in flight I enquired about my daughters child's meal I was informed there was no child's meals and only the cheese pizzaÃ¢- again! I asked the flight attendant if my daughter could have her meal as they had now commenced serving the food. The flight attendant asked the manager came back and stated as per the manager my daughter would have to wait and that she did not wish to skip rows. I informed the flight attendant that those passengers who had ordered special meals ie: vegetarian meal had already received their meals. She stated she was following direction from the manager. Landing into Toronto my daughter was struggling and was crying and screaming. I was holding my daughter to soothe her when the in-flight manager abruptly informed me that my daughter had to be in her seat seatbelt fastened. I informed the manager that I was attempting to calm my daughter down and was trying my best when she indicated that my daughter would have to be in her seat and that if she did not take her seat that she would have to inform the Captain that the cabin was not secure and that we would not be able to land. I would not suggest Sunwing to a family/friend. This airline lacks in professionalism and customer service.,Passive
 Phoenix to Austin. My review is for my son who who bumped out of his seat on his flight home from Phoenix to Austin. He had early checked in online 24 hours earlier and already had his boarding pass on his IPhone when he arrive at the gate. He arrived at the gate 15 minutes before the plane was due to depart. The person at the boarding pass scanner told my son your seat was just given away to a standby passenger. The gate agent gave my sons seat away right at the time my son arrived telling my son he was late but he was not late. So the gate agent was looking to bump someone off the flight in order to accommodate a middle aged couple maybe because they had made some sort of excuse. It was not right for the American Airlines gate agent to give my son seat away as he already had his boarding pass and they could have let him board but would not. They claimed he was late to the gate but he was right there while the gate agent was giving away his seat to another standby passenger.,Detractor
Flight 103 on October 14. We flew from London to Calgary Alberta - a long cramped ride. It was on the new Dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! Service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything. When the coffee did come it was lukewarm. There was not one good thing about our flight. We will never travel British Airways again.,Detractor
"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience.",Passive
YYZ-PEK - March 20 - April 11 - The staff who work for Air Canada must be really unhappy in their jobs - no smiles here. The food on board could be greatly improved.

The toilet was also unclean and that was at the beginning of the flight.,Passive
"  Left Nairobi more or less on time-had to wait for a thunderstorm to pass before take off. Premium Economy seat is better than Economy in that there is more leg room. Flight was packed and the 777 was subdivided into First, Club, Business, Premium Economy and Economy - not sure whether all these subdivisions are really necessary - it would have been better to provide customers with a more modern/newer aircraft instead of an older 777 with all these seating alternatives that look rather dated. Food was average, choice between ""grilled steak"" and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out cake as a dessert. Cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food, they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way as quickly as possible. It was a night flight and they disappeared until 1 hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast - a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful, dry cereal bar. Arrived on time and immediately went for a coffee and a snack at the airport-which of course should have been served as a breakfast on the flight.

" Skavsta to Stanford. Would never recommend using this airlane after today's experience. First we arrive at 5 pm in the morning, at the cost of our night sleep. When we have checked in our bags and gone through security, they inform that not airplane is coming, due to late arrival, until seven to eight hours later. Still they could not offer any hotel room until four hours would pass, as the airplane could come earlier than their estimation. When we arrive the second time the plane is first estimated 30 minutes later than before, then to change into one hour. No personal of Ryanair was reachable neither at the airport nor through phone. Later departure to the same destination by Ryanair went into air as normal without any possibility for us to board that plane.

The crew however was very professional and offered candies and water to all the passengers while waiting they also showed a Disney cartoon while we were still waiting on the ground. When we were in the air the food service started very quickly and went by very smoothly. The meal was a sandwich which actually was just enough for a night flight. Drinks were complimentary. The only thing that I can complain about is that the cabin was very worn including the toilet. It felt quite dirty and shabby for example the armrests were very loose.

"  Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight. We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world's favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA's Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger's feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous",Detractor

SIN-CHC overnight flight in economy. Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys.

Inflight entertainment was impressive, but the remote for my seat stopped working half way to Bangkok. All in all, a very good seat not backed up by a first class experience.",Passive
"This six hour leg from Minneapolis to Anchorage was the worst flight I have taken in a decade. For some unknown reason, Delta chose to put an aircraft with no power outlets and no USB connection on a 2500 mile route. The seats were hard and had limited recline. The meal service, when it finally came, was appalling. No nuts or pretzels were offered with drinks. The meal had no appetizer, no bread, the portions of the main course were tiny and unappetizing, and the dessert was some kind of nasty lemon gelatto that was half melted. The cabin crew was surly, indifferent, and hid behind the curtains in the galley for most of the flight. After several hours of no service, one water run was made before landing. And this was in First Class no less ! I cannot recommend Delta under any circumstances.",Detractor
"BA 1321 Newcastle to Heathrow 1/4/15. Check in at Newcastle was as always very fast and efficient. Once on board the cabin crew did a great job of welcoming everyone. A great crew offering old school BA charm at it's best and no small achievement considering the very early departure time. New and very ""compact"" seating which seems to be the new norm for economy class travel on short haul European flights.

And this member lounge is not far from the gate. Because of the reasons for the time difference, boarding, I directly put on the eye mask to rest. But when I woke up the crew asked me if I want to eat something, I had the pasta, toast, as well as desserts and chocolate. The crew is very friendly, it is a good trip, that is, the aircraft seat spacing is not large.",Passive
When I booked ticket (3 in total) to travel the end of June 2014 from Canada to Barcelona Spain I booked with Air Canada and wanted AC to be my carrier. However I know find out we will be travelling with Air Canada Rouge the company's low cost carrier. I also have found out there will be NO entertainment unless you go out and buy an Ipad and the seats are going to be smaller and tighter together. There are other cuts and this is totally unfair to me as an Air Canada customer. I did not get any rebate for flying with this low cost carrier - absolutely nothing. It is just tough luck for us. I like travelling with Air Canada with their experienced crews and the special benefits that go along with the overseas flights. I am not happy about this - I feel like we have been Rouged by Air Canada.,Detractor

ADL-LHR via HKG. Check-in at ADL quick and easy well organised. Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through. Cathay Pacific you need to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.,Passive
"Brisbane to Athens via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways was the worst journey of my life. My daughter, a size 12, managed to squeeze into the seat. I'm an 18 and so not comfortable.

Not happy to find most of them empty, and the man sat next to me, had just moved himself up from a seat at the back! The one upside, was the man at Athens Airport, who arranged my upgrade, was wonderful, and the lady he sent me to see to pay for my upgrade was also brilliant.

My wife and I were supposed to fly out of Fort Myers on Oct 22/14 after booking our flights two months in advance. When we got to the airport 3 hours before our flight we were told our flight was cancelled and we would have to wait until 8.30 the next day before we could leave. We had to call for a ride ask to stay an additional day - all with no notice! They had all of my contact info and never called. I believe our flight wasn't full so they bumped us to the next morning to fill that flight. This is unacceptable you schedule your flights to fit into your time schedule not theirs.

Three recent trips on Southwest (AUS-DEN DEN-SMF SFO-PHX). All three were delayed with times ranging from an acceptable 20 mins to a nail biting 75 mins delay which meant we almost missed our connecting flight.

Southwest used to be so different from the competition but I don't think this is the case anymore. Free checked bags is certainly an advantage though.,Passive
" Paris to New York. I particularly asked for a vegan meal when I booked the flight one month in advance. On Skyteam it appears that vegan meals are referred to as vegetarian non-dairy. I booked my flight on Premium Economy on Air France. There are two meals offered from Paris to New York. First is the main meal which was vegan but I noticed that because it was vegan, I got less food than the vegetarian sitting next to me. One and a half hours before the flight was set to land, a sandwich snack was offered to me. It looked like a chicken sandwich. When I notified the flight attendant, she took the sandwich back and disappeared until the flight was about to land. Other flight attendants came through quickly pick up the trash. No one bothered to follow up with me. I felt cramped in premium economy seating but I guess it offered extra legroom than regular economy.",Detractor
"Vienna to New York JFK via Istanbul, and the flight from Vienna to Istanbul was pleasant and generally unremarkable until landing in Istanbul. It was pouring rain, the aircraft was parked and buses arrived to take us to the main airport. A bus for business class was provided, however when we tried to board, a ground person aggressive waved his arms and yelled, ""No more"". I said, ""we are business class,"" and tried to show my boarding pass only to have him become more aggressive, and shout, ""go"". There are no signs in the gate areas to direct traveler with connections to the the business class lounges. The flight from Istanbul to New York JFK was dismal. I will say the only saving grace is the food service is very good. The overhead bins are literally 1/3 filled with bedding and other equipment. The crew seemed trained to ignore service than provide service. Baggage service at JFK was very slow, and of course when our bags finally arrived, they were completely soaked, obviously having been left out uncovered in Istanbul!",Detractor

Firstly, staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing. The food was embarrassing bad - bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls.

"  Was flying first time with LOT Polish Airlines Zurich to Tallinn via Warsaw. First leg to WAW with E170. Seats very comfy and good pitch.

Flight due to late arrival and bad weather conditions in ZRH 40 minutes delayed, arrived 15 minutes late at WAW airport. All transfers were granted. A solid performance for the price I paid for the ticket. LOT Biz lounge not that big, a little cramped, but with one of the best food choices in Europe. Was having a superb Polish soup for lunch. Second leg on an CRJ900 from Nordica, repainted with the LOT logo, but still registered in Estonia. All crew but the purser (LOT employee) were from Nordica, service was LOT, like in a wet lease.

My wife and I flew from Las Vegas to Incheon (KE005) and Incheon to Bangkok (KE657) on December 17 2014. Check-in at Las Vegas was quick and easy. Staff were very professional and polite. Our aircraft was a Boeing 777 from Las Vegas and the flight was completely full. I was very disappointed in Korean's B777 33 in. pitch in economy seating. My knees were jammed into the seat in front of me the whole 12.5 hour flight making for a very uncomfortable trip. I am 6 ft. tall and 33 inch seat pitch is just not enough space for the 12 plus hour flight. It was also very difficult to eat from the tray table when it is jammed into your lap contributing to a very bad flight experience. Korean Air seems to be missing the point when they skimp on customer seat space to enhance their bottom line in profits. Seat space is my only main complaint about Korean Air's commitment to quality of service. I might add that KE657 was an older B747 and to my surprise offered more seat pitch in their economy seating in the 6 hour trip than on their B777's 12 hour trip. From now on my airline loyalty will not be based on price but on seating comfort. Maybe flying an airline with premium economy class may be my next choice.,Detractor

"  London Heathrow - Abu Dhabi - Sydney and return in the First class apartment. The apartment is superb. Much more refined than the Emirates suite, and in a different league from Qantas or BA First. The separate seat and bed set-up is excellent, there's a great feeling of spaciousness, and lots of storage. The vanity unit is a nice touch. The whole thing exudes class. Unfortunately I didn't find the bed desperately comfortable. It is extremely hard, even for someone who likes a firm bed. They need to invest in some thicker mattresses to deal with this as a priority. The shower is good, though not close to the quality of the EK bathrooms. Amenity kits were nothing special and didn't include deodorant. When I used my own, the spray set off the smoke detector and I was interrupted when only half-dressed by three crew members rather aggressively demanding to know if I was having a cigarette while showering. The toilet lighting was very dim on all four sectors which was a bit frustrating. The on board chefs were all exceptional in their attitude, and happy to make bespoke dishes (within reason), the F&B managers more varied and I didn't really see the point of them. Other crew were consistently very good indeed. IFE was ok with a pretty good selection of recent and older films. Transfers in AUH were speedy (though not well signposted) but First Class priority at security was not open. The (shared business and First) lounge at LHR was quite small but ok. Spa treatments for First passengers complimentary. AUH lounge not especially spacious either but with spa where I enjoyed an excellent massage and paid a small amount for a traditional shave (which was superb). A la carte breakfast was very good. SYD business and First lounge pleasant but no spa. Very friendly staff. Flights on time and any issues always explained. One big annoyance - at check in in Sydney I spotted that my confirmed seat had been changed to a much less attractive one. The senior customer service representative couldn't work out why and after several conversations and calls discovered a couple travelling together wanted to be in adjacent seats, but hadn't reserved ahead. They had persuaded somebody senior, who should have known better, to displace me without asking. I was extremely displeased, not least that the change had been made unilaterally, for non-operational reasons. I had it changed back and received an apology from the agent (though not the person responsible), but it left a sour taste. Overall, however, easily now my favourite first class, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.",Promoter

Manchester to Melbourne via Abu. Dhabi. We paid for the extra legroom seats in economy class and were really glad we did. The seats are only narrow and I am classed as being thin.

"  I hadn't flown Cathay Pacific for a number of years, but I always remembered them being a very comfortable airline offering a better than average product. As a disclaimer, my airline of choice for this route (Los Angeles to Singapore via Hong Kong) has always been Singapore Airlines, so I realize I may have high standards. However, I'm still just an average economy traveler who simply expects to be taken care of on long flights. The trip out from LAX to SIN was a bit treacherous due to mechanical problems. This, I understand, but the way the airline handled it was - I'd say - less than satisfactory. I had a scheduled 01.25 departure that was delayed 11 hours. I was not made aware of the fact until 19.00 the night of my flight. The reason for the delay was the plane had engine problems when it was leaving HK (for LAX) and had to turn around, but what made it extremely confusing was that the airline somehow did not make the delay public knowledge (Google Flights, Flight Tracker and others had the flight noted as an on time departure), so there was quite a bit of confusion. I decided to arrive at the airport at my normal time (~2 hrs prior) at which point the delay was confirmed. I asked if they could put me on another flight of any other airline because I was going to SIN for a family emergency and I was told there were no available seats. They offered to put me up in a hotel which I accepted and gave me meal vouchers that didn't cover the cost of a single dish (for either dinner or breakfast - $25 and $15 respectively). The next morning upon check-in, I was told that my flights out were not full because they had moved many passengers to other flights/airlines - this really irritated me because I was told there were no available seats the night before. Once I finally arrived in HK (11.5 hours later than expected), my flight to SIN was delayed an additional 4 hours. At this point, I went to the CX counter and kindly asked for a pass to the lounge so I could rest and shower, since I'd already been delayed in my travels. They said they couldn't help me because they'd already compensated me in LA with the hotel stay. This irritated me",Passive
"This was my first time flying in premium economy and although Air France has rightfully received praised regarding this class, I found seat comfort to be rather disappointing. The seats don't incline but a partial 'rocker' on the seat allows you to arch your back which creates an uncomfortable contrast between the stillness of the seat and this ""rocking"" part. However, this is the only setback of Air France's premium economy. The crew was very friendly and helpful. Champagne was served and the service shared similarities with business class. The tray table was covered with a cloth, and the cutlery was elaborate. The food was tasty and refined. Finally the IFE was diverse although the screen could have been more responsive and modern.

Paris to Buenos Aires on Iberia simply because their Business Class costs almost half of what you pay for AF. Since its such a long flight anyway the two hour transit in Madrid didn't really bother me. Departure from Orly in Paris is always a better choice as you'll be leaving from a small airport without the hassle and the crowds of CDG. The IB Business lounge at ORY is very good with excellent food options and even if it is located before security checks but with IB Business Class you get Fast Track security check and you have no queues. During the two hour flight to Madrid you get a very decent hot breakfast served by friendly FA's. Transit at Madrid T4 is very easy and despite the long distances I was in the long-haul terminal business lounge within 20 minutes after landing. Unfortunately it gets very busy before noon with all flights to North & South America leaving more or less same time. Once on board the A340-600 I was thrilled to see the new cabin layout providing a very clever single seating and privacy for nearly everyone. The seats are very comfortable turning easily to a fully flat bed. On the 12 hours MAD-BUE sector I managed to sleep for almost half of the flight. The crew was very polite and available at all times. The downside is with catering where Iberia promotes Spanish cuisine but it may not be to everyone's taste when your lunch choice consists of roasted pig baked cod or vegetarian lasagne. For the starter the foie gras was nice but in Business you shouldn't serve a gaspacho direct from a carton box! No cheese or fruit available for dessert just sweet puddings.

I recently spent between $3000 and $4000 for 3 seats on Air Canada for a vacation to the United Kingdom for my wife sister and me. It was important for all of us to sit together. When I tried to get seat assignments their computer system did not work. I had to call instead and spent much time on the phone getting it done. We made the flight to London and were served a small breakfast and I was skipped. On the flight home we were shunted from one departure gate to another. On our third different one the computer system would not work and we were told we would have to be moved yet again when it finally kicked in. As we were boarding our final flight the stewardess pulled my sister from her seat and gave it to another person. I protested and asked how that could happen and we were told that a husband and wife who had not bothered to reserve adjacent seats had asked for my sister's reserved seat and they just gave it to them breaking up our family group to do so.

I will never fly Qatar Airways again flying Manchester-Doha-Johannesburg and return. Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse.

"  Vancouver to Bangkok via Hong Kong during the Christmas peak travel season. I was unimpressed right from the start. Whatever happened to Cathay's ground staff in Vancouver isn't good and should be fixed immediately. Barely any smiles or greetings for frequent flyers and seemed ignorant to all requests and questions. My flight was delayed by 45 minutes and I asked if I could be moved my connecting flight to Bangkok in order to ensure both me and my bags make it. I got a response of ""No, the flight still shows on-time arrival. You will have plenty of time, plus, since you have a tight connection, your bags will be off-loaded first."" From previous experiences, any delays when flying against the jet stream through the Pacific Ocean mean extra delays, which is exactly what happened on this flight. Flight time to Hong Kong from Vancouver was 14 hours, approximately an hour longer than usual. Landed Hong Kong 45 minutes late, and I had to run for my life across the busy terminal to make my connection to Bangkok. I asked the ground staff at the gate in Hong Kong to check if my luggage has made it and by the time the flight was closing, they still ""weren't able to locate my bags"". I was discouraged and accepted the fact that my bags were going to miss the flight yet again. Landed in Bangkok on time, one of my bags showed up which was a blessing but the other took a later flight and got delivered to my house. Economy seats on the Boeing 777-300ER are great, one of the best in the industry in fact. While I was rushing to board my flight to Bangkok, which was operated on the Airbus A350-900 (exciting!), my boarding pass got an error message and hence I got upgraded to Premium Economy Class for the flight. The A350 cabin is by far one of the best in the skies nowadays and Cathay Pacific has properly defined the meaning of ""Premium Economy"" perfectly: the extra legroom, the seat amenities, the IFE, just to name a few. Food was amazing for Economy, edible and appropriate portions. Advice: Don't get the pasta unless you really have to. Go with the Western or Asian menu. Cabin crew service continues to be top notch on both flights, especially on the short-haul from Hong Kong to Bangkok. They really do care about their frequent fliers, so Vancouver ground staff, step it up!

  We flew Icelandair from Boston to London. We purchased travel protection when purchasing the tickets. There was a terrible accident in route to the airport (London) which caused huge delays. We arrived 40 min prior to scheduled departure but they would not let us even see if we could make the flight which turned out to be delayed anyway. They had 5 unsold seats on a flight leaving 5 hours later for which they wanted to charge us $3150 USD to change and they gave us 7 minutes to decide or they would cancel the remainder of our ticket (KEF to BOS). We tried to call the travel insurance to see if they would offer more assistance but they said claims should be filed afterwards. My husband went to talk to the Icelandair agents and explain we just got an email that the flight was delayed but they said it was too late and the entire ticket was now canceled. We spent $2200 to buy tickets on another carrier to fly directly from London to BOS. I filled a claim form on-line 28 days ago and received an auto generated email saying the review could take up to 14 days but I still haven't heard anything! I sent a follow up request through their website (no email address listed) 10 days ago.

Both legs we took to London (BOS-KEF) and (KEF-LGW) were delayed 1 and 2 hours respectively. We got a small water bottle on the first leg but were offered nothing else either time. This is easily the worst flying experience I have ever had and we travel about 4-5 times a year.,Detractor
Cape Town to Bangkok-departed on time excellent IFE good quality food and drink. Airline staff seemed a bit scarce! But we're mostly engaging and friendly.

LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.,Promoter
" Seattle to Charleston via Newark. Today I missed my sons family day because me and my wife have been stuck with no car. (In which we had reservations to pick up at 12 am after getting off the plane November 6, 2018). We didn't make it to the airport in Charleston till 1:30am they gave the car to someone else because we can't call up in the air. We have been up for over 24 hours. We are extremely exhausted and we are still sitting at this airport because we have to wait until a car comes available. Oh by the way it's 10:50 am November 7, 2018 I can't even think straight anymore so disappointing. The most important thing in my sons life and i missed it.",Detractor
"  Denver to San Francisco. This was the last leg of a SFO-DEN return trip. The booking was for a 6:50pm departure. We left after 12AM. I explained that because they left so late, I would miss my airporter and could not catch another until 8:AM when the airporter resumes service. The airline reply was that since they did not cancel the flight I would get nothing but a $15 food voucher. I find this inexcusable and will not use Frontier again. Also as a tip, even though I gave myself 3 hours to catch my airporter, it wasn't enough to compensate for an inept organization. And lastly, they charged me $45 each way for a carry on luggage. Poor customer service and a nickel and dime charge policy.",Detractor
"CGN-LIS booked long ago (05/2013) when their new fare scheme (Smart Best etc.) was not implemented yet thus I sat in seat 1F with generous legroom but got only a few points credited. But it was a good price and a generally acceptable standard as far as baggage allowance seat quality etc. is concerned. Flight left a little late no apology or reason given but with good tailwinds we made an on time arrival. Service on board was ok although the quality of their turkey salami sandwich is well below my standard it's just the fluffy British-American sandwich style not using the crispy rolls we like in Germany. On such ""longer flights"" of more than two hours they should offer a pasta or a similar hot dish as their parent company does on similar routes. Beverages were served as well - standard ones free of charge special ones or alcoholic drinks for a hefty price which is unacceptable to me (almost five Euros for a small bottle of wine (187 ml) in a plastic glass). No newspapers or other ""entertainment"". Friendly and efficient service. I have to tell myself again and again: you get what you paid for - and that's what I did on this flight.",Passive
"SAS Scandinavian flight from Oslo to Stockholm. 15 year old plane, not doing too bad for its age. Clean and tidy onboard. Cabin Crew were welcoming and happy.

"  Dubai to Auckland via Melbourne with Emirates. Sat in window seat 19J (aisle), my husband in sat in window seat behind that was more private. Very pleasant and efficient crew who served meals fast. Emirates did not have any women's amenity kits onboard, so I received a men's one. Some of the passengers in middle rows had seats that were malfunctioning and would not recline, I felt very sorry for them, at the start of a 14.5 hour flight when you've paid a lot of extra dollars for a lie flat seat, that isn't very good. Our previous flight which was shorter had the same issues with seats. Business class was full on this flight, so no way to move seats. Seats are comfy enough with the mattress topper but a little on the short side for me. Much room is devoted to the minibar at the side of your seat, I would rather have a wider seat, the drinks are not chilled either, so I just got chilled drinks / water from the bar. Good selection of movies and TV shows etc. The bar was fabulous, I woke up early (3am) and had a coffee. Could not fault the attentive and very helpful staff, any problems were due to lack of maintenance of seats and ground crew not loading amenity kits.",Passive
"  Gatwick to Perth via Dubai. Emirates do not care and customer service is a joke. I received a bland apology and they flatly denied I was booked in as vegetarian, something which I double checked as I booked through an agent. Unfortunately I was served vegan food, which was appalling. They tried to serve the same dreadful dishes twice on the same trip. Not the gourmet food promised on their website. The cabin crew did their best to rustle up something edible, but when I finally was served a vegetarian meal on the last flight of the trip - a meal which had been rejected by another passenger - it was a very hot, spicy chick pea meal with a raw chilli in it. Not everyone reacts well to hot spicy food and I am one of them. Dubai Airport is a disgrace - the customer service staff were surly and unhelpful. I was not advised that there was a business lounge nearer to my boarding gate, (the gate number was on the pass, so that would not have been difficult) resulting in a long, last minute dash to the gate. On the return flight, finding the correct lounge was nigh impossible, and I and another passenger had to ask a cleaner as no customer service staff were anywhere to be seen. The signage was inadequate. As for the Fast Track passes handed out on both the flights, these were meaningless and we were herded through with the rest of the passengers. A 15 minute (at least) bus ride from the plane to the terminal was the last straw. To summarise I paid three times the economy price for a lie flat bed and a few glasses of champagne. Not the exciting, wonderful experience promised by Emirates, and they are so big they really do not care.",Detractor

" Orlando to Cleveland. It was my first time flying Spirit Airlines. They got me safely to my destination on time, and I would fly them again. Newer A320. Pilots were professional. Flight attendants were nice (albeit they didn't have much to do since very few folks bought in flight food). Their web site could not process a itinerary change for me, the system kept being hung up on the seat selection page. I tried it on several different devices with no luck. I had to call in and they made the change for me for no charge. My leg room was good because I was in an exit row. However, the seat bottom was worn and was uncomfortable. I could endure it for a two-hour flight, but any longer would have been really bad. The entire airplane interior looked tired and worn despite only being two years old. Their checked baggage limit is less than other airlines, 40 pounds. This was an issue as both our bags were a few pounds over. We borrowed a portable luggage scale from the hotel front desk (i recommend getting one if you fly these ULCC's often) and maneuvered things to get the weight below 40 pounds. This also meant a trip to the UPS store to ship a box of things home. $30 at the UPS store was a better option than $60+ for two marginally overweight bags. If you understand how their scheme works, you can fly for a low price. But if you add on all the things that a regular airline include for free, the price isn't much less, if at all. If Southwest or a major airline was flying nonstop to my destination, I'd pick them every time. But I'd have no problem picking Spirit again if they were the best option.",Passive
" Akron to Orlando. I came to the airport at 4:20 Pm like they required, my flight was at 8:50 Pm this people.

Last delay was at 11:50PM we got in the plane and stayed there for an hour when they decided to tell us pilots were leaving because their time fly was expired and they were not allowed to fly anymore. We waited in there for a new pair of pilots to come in and 30 mins later they asked us to get off the plane and run to the other side of the airport, pass through TSA and catch a ""new flight"". We get to the terminal 81 and we stayed there until 1:10 AM when we finally left the airport. I asked the supervisor if at least they will give us some complimentary water he said we don't have any. I lost my car rental because by the time we arrived at the other airport everything was closed 3:00AM and had to wait there until 6:30 that they reopened.",Detractor
Inconsistent service! We travelled outbound London to Bangkok business class on TG911 on 15th January 2014. Throughout the flight the service was second to none and we had thought Thai had really upped their game. The staff were superb the inflight meal service extremely well presented and of a good standard. The entertainment reasonable. Sadly the return journey in business class TG 910 on 28/29 January 2014 fell so very far short of satisfactory. The staff were surly and obviously didn't want to be there and not particularly helpful. The drinks and meal service was shocking! The staff were on a mission to 'throw' everything at the passengers as soon as possible so they had nothing to do from there on! The drinks and meal service was completed within less than an hour of take off before we had chance to have a drink our meal was virtually thrown at us and cleared before completion. Similarly the breakfast service was faster than McDonalds and the meal dry and inedible (scrambled egg which had solidified) the whole return journey felt unwelcoming and one I would not wish to experience again especially given the premium pricing! Hence sadly reducing my overall rating of this airline from what could have been substantially higher if based on the outward journey only!,Passive

I've had at least eight Germanwings flights in the last two years. One thing I don't see in other reviews is the fact Germanwings will charge 7 Euro/kilo for anything over 20 kilos (44 lbs) on checked bags. This can be an unpleasant surprise. Naturally they refuse to pay you the same rate for underweight bags. In the last two years they have also occasionally weighed carry on bags with a limit of 10 kilo.

Meal service was quite slow, and FAs didn't bother to ask me if I wanted a drink, just breezed past me. Meal collection was also slow - 1 hour to collect trays. Most of the FAs seemed unconcerned with their passengers. Food was OK. Exit Row seats were good, and worth the extra $. MUN-SIN: different story, plane, a 777 appeared cleaner and newer, and FAs were attentive. Sitting not even halfway through the plane, couldn't get my first meal choice on either Dinner or Breakfast. Exit row seats not worth it - cart kept banging into my partner's leg/tv screen as the config of the aisle makes there be a little ""turn"". Window seat on this exit row also has a restricted leg room due to protruding of the exit door. Singapore should rethink this config and do 2-3-2 for the bulkhead to make a bit more space.

The ground staff announced in English that we would be boarding from the rear of he plane and started to announce a range of rows.

" I would advise against flying WOW air. I flew out of BWI and they straight up lied to me saying that my connecting flight was down for maintenance.

I have since been in contact with WOW air for 4 months and they continue to lie to me about compensating me. For four months they have said that the will be making this right and yet, nothing.

We travelled economy from Manchester to Toronto via Heathrow The flight from Manchester to Heathrow and return was very good. The seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. The service from the cabin crew was excellent. The leg from Heathrow to Toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. The seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. Whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. Unfortunately BA were let down by the attendants on the return leg from Toronto to Heathrow. Whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable I have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. We had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. The lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. The steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. He did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. Even after take off she had to ask again. When they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. The steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. This had not appeared by the time I had finished eating my meal so I gave her the bottle from mine (My daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) Shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. The passengers on the other aisle were served about 15 mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. I asked for a glass of orange and a tea (as I had not drunk anything on the 6 hour flight).

" London to Shanghai via Hong Kong. The first-class cabin, with just six seats, is great. The wine list, led by Krug, is excellent, though short. The on-board service is attentive and generally excellent. After you kick off the meal with caviar, the food is disappointing. I realize that preparing food in the air presents particular challenges, but I don't know why airlines serve overcooked and underseasoned dishes. My main gripe with Cathay is with the ground service, which is non-existent. The First lounges are hard to find and not worth the trouble as the service and food are limited and worse than in business. For goodness sake: Even at the home airport of Hong Kong, there was no help with finding how to transit or to find the lounge. The low point for me was when I finally found the right place to transit, I was sent back to the CX desk because my boarding pass wouldn't scan.

Check-in in Toronto was OK no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate.

" Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight. The service and cabin staff were excellent, even on the old A330!",Promoter
" New Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata. First time flying with Air India. Was a bit excited when I found out I will be flying in the Boeing 787-8 to Kolkata, and from there, connecting flight to Dhaka in an Airbus A319. Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom. The onboard served snack wasn't good on this one. There was dry, cold Singara and cake. The plane made some noises during the flight. This Aircraft, perhaps ,wasn't properly maintained. Anyways, landed in Dhaka after a 1 hr flight. Overall experience was really good.",Passive
My wife and I flew the Toronto-Cancun route 3 times this season. (AC10-11) and were pleasantly surprised. When Rouge began operating this service I wrote a very negative review. I believe they have listened and are trying. My biggest complaint from the beginning was the insane seating discomfort. The new plane flying this route is a 767 and it is quiet clean maintained very well and the seating is very comfortable. The crew do their best and I have no problems with them whatsoever. Sometimes the flights were delayed but all in all we arrived safe and in good shape. That's all I ask of any airline when push comes to shove. The little nitpicky stuff pales beside safety and the incredible shape and performance of the aircraft and pilots gets us all back home. I am liking this route now and will not hesitate to purchase from Rouge. I think they should be applauded for righting a wrong.,Promoter
"Shanghai to Los Angeles. Had difficulties with American Airline online booking management as it does not allow changes or upgrade by cash through internet, which is kind of lame as most of other airlines allow that. The online seat selecting is not helpful as it was impossible for me to select three seats in a row due to American Airlines money-making seating regulations. Fortunately staff at PVG was very understanding and helpful and as we arrived quite early, and he arranged D,E,H for my parents and I. Aircraft was new and I liked it. Took off on time and the inflight entertainment more than enough, but maybe not so enough for non-English speakers such as my parents. Food was ok and flight attendants doing their jobs.

" San Antonio to Flint via Chicago. We will never fly with American Airlines again. As a precursor, I am a consistent traveler and have flown through just about every airline, experienced delays/cancellations, ect. As long as customer service present, I'm understanding and compliant. Unfortunately, the customer service experience element of AA wasn't present today. To start, I received an email update our initial flight to our connecting flight was going to be delayed. Then we received another notification that it was delayed again. This second delay made us too late to make our connecting flight. We called and spoke to a representative from American Airlines and he said ALL flights were going to be canceled due to weather. This seemed shocking, so we hung up and called back. The second person said some flights were delayed, but not ALL canceled. We decided to go to the airport to see what options were available. Initially our first question was, â€œWith this delay, will our connecting flight be delayed?â€ She said it was going to be on time and we would definitely miss is. She began suggesting alternative plans. We asked if we could transfer to other flights, she said she had nothing. We asked for other airlines, she said they had nothing. We asked to change our arrival city to be Detroit instead of Flint (Essentially we were trying to come up with solutions and she just stood there waiting for us to ask the right question to solve the problemâ€”offering no suggestions of her own) Finally with that idea, she confirmed that was available. Okay, great. We went with that option. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for American Airline to book us a hotel and she emphasized it was the best option because of the 24 hr shuttle service which is perfect since we had a 5am flight. As soon as we get settled in the hotel, I receive an email notification that our connecting flight was delayed. I called and we could not get back on that flight and now obligated to take the new flight out the next day... We arrive to the hotel, check in and there is no 24 hr shuttle(after we were told there would be). We are told we have to provide our own transportation because we had an early flight. I called American Airlines to see if they could correct this, they said no, but we could file a claim. Next morning, we arrive back at the airport after we had to find a way to get there and our tickets had been voided. (What?!) They said our tickets had been changed/edited 11 times before it was finally just canceled! So, now we're tired and frustrated because we were ill advised as to which flight to get on, no shuttle, had to pay for our own transportation, had to pay for a rental vehicle, and had to still pay for our seats and baggage check in. I'm not upset that I had to pay for seats and luggage or transportation and etc, I'm upset there was no customer service with this airline. We will never fly through this airline again and will be sure to inform others of our experience.",Detractor

"  Quick weekend break to Madrid and a wonderful experience of KLM. The price was outstanding via a travel website. Ground staff, in Newcastle, Amsterdam and Madrid were friendly, proactive and efficient. Onboard, cabin staff were possibly the most friendly I've encountered. They couldn't do enough and never seemed harassed. The seats were more than adequate for 2-3 hours. On the shorter Newcastle sectors we were served a small cake and a drink, and the longer hop to Madrid a hot pizza. Bags were rapidly delivered. They were trialling the new AirFi system on the Madrid route - it wasn't internet access, but streaming entertainment, games and news loaded on which you could access with your wifi device - a great idea. Amsterdam was easy to navigate (much more than CDG or LHR). The transit into/out of the Schengen area without any queuing.

July 31 we were on flight 3143 NAS to MIA. Flight was scheduled to take off at 605. We were on the runway on time when a passenger became ill. We returned to the terminal. They left her on board until a paramedic arrived to check her out. At this point she felt better and wanted to continue but had to wait until someone from headquarters arrived to determine if it was safe for her to stay on the flight. They took her off the plane then allowed her to return then took her off again. Every person on that plane had a connecting flight to catch. They then had to refuel the plane. We then got back on the runway then had to go back to check out a maintenance issue. We sat there another 30 minutes. Then we had to get off the plane while they worked on it. At 9.30 we boarded again then had to wait for a passenger who couldn't decide whether or not to continue. We finally left NAS at 10 pm. When we landed in MIA we had to go back through customs find our luggage then try to find someone from AA to help us all reschedule flights. No one from AA was available to help us until after 11 pm. They put us up overnight at a local hotel and rescheduled all our flights for the next day but it was a very poorly handled situation. I do not plan to use AA in the future. We have used other airlines many times and have had issues but never anything handled this poorly.,Detractor
I cannot fault Ryanair on our recent trip to France. Flew out 16th April and back on 23rd April. We were 10 minutes late setting off (through no fault of their own someone had left a buggy at the steps and could not fly until they found the owner). The pilot made up the lost time and we landed on time in France. The return flight left on time and we arrived 25 mins early in England. Check in etc were smooth and no problems.,Promoter

MAN-DXB-CPT in business class. The chauffeur service on time. The Manchester lounge was one of the best lounges I've ever used. The flight to DXB was the A380 - the business seats and service are very good. We never bothered with the bar at the back but it did look good. The business lounge at DXB was fairly gruesome to be honest. To crowded dirty and quite a let down after Manchester. The flight to CPT was a 777-300ER. The seats and facilities are not a patch on the A380 still much better than economy. The service was better probably due to the fewer business class passengers. The return flight was all 777-300ER on both legs. Again the seats weren't the best but the food and service on all the legs was generally very good. The chauffeur service was excellent. Our bags turned up first both at CPT and MAN. Overall a very positive experience.,Promoter
"HKG-ICN - my wife and myself had some difficulty in getting our seats assigned. Initially I thought this is due to our ""ultra competitive fare"" not allowing advance seat reservation but the real reason seemed to be that Cathay made an equipment change from A333 to B773 at very short notice only hours before departure. Thus we did not get the desired twin-seat in the Airbus but a neighbour in the 3-3-3 configuration of the 777. All the rest was ""standard procedure"" in Cathay's five star level. On time departure arrival ahead of schedule well managed inflight service despite a full cabin. Friendly and polite cabin crew but clearly focussed due to the number of pax to be served. AVOD ok but this is not ranking high in my priority list. I prefer a good choice of reading options which I got plus a decent meal and a good beverage selection. This being a morning flight the emphasis was more on tea and coffee - and only later on wine. I got all I needed and am once again really content with Cathay.",Promoter

Friendly Staff acceptable seating good catering. But both directions long haul flights the seats reserved during booking process were not any more reserved during check in. On AMS SFO it was a minor issue because of availability and assignment of two other seats located together. On the return it was worse. Assignment was 15 rows between the seats. To solve the topic found out during internet checkin I wanted to use the customer service hotline during check in which was not available by phone despite of 20 minute Queuing at the phone. The other communication methods offered by KLM (facebook communicator were not accessible from my mobile device using for internet check in). I solved the problem afterwards by myself finding close seats and negotiating with other passengers.

Also we always enjoy a brandy on our long haul flights, and on the return journey they did not have any.

Chicago to St. Louis round-trip. All flights were on time with friendly service. Midday in Chicago I cleared security in 10 minutes. Mobile boarding pass is very helpful. Boarding was quick and easy.

St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights.

The premium economy fare was comparable to standard economy fares on competing United and Alaska. Unlike some US airlines Virgin America does not require babies under 2 to have their own seat. There is a level of courtesy and engagement with the customer among the cabin and ground staff that is not seen among the US legacy airlines. Cabin crew made sure we were comfortable. Flights on time and the bulkhead left just enough space to change a nappy (diaper in USA) on the floor in front of the seats.

I saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers.

As we were offloaded from the second cancelled flight at 10.30pm the cabin crew announced there was no hotel accommodation available so we were 'on our own'! Literally used those words. Also announced that there was food available from the flight but not enough for everyone so 'if you don't need it, please don't take it'. No communication regarding alternate flights. Seriously, they didn't care! Would never fly this airline again. I recommend Norwegian Airlines who really stepped up to help me!",Detractor
Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,Passive
"Emirates have gone backwards. Accra to Dubai leg was in a Boeing 777-300er, one flight attendant had a rude attitude whilst the other was great. Unfortunately the rude one was in our cabin. The 777 business class seats are outdated and other airlines have much better seating. Food and service was below average. Dubai to Sydney in an A380, crew were friendly but could not seem to get it together. I was travelling with a partner and food only came to one of us and not together, every single time my food orders were incorrect. Meals are getting smaller and are the same on other routes. Meals were served and wines were poured after meals ended. Comfort wise I was able to get some sleep in the A380 seats. Overall a below average experience with Emirates.",Detractor

"I am a frequent traveler. I booked round trip tickets for two. The first flight was to leave at 6.05 am. We loaded on time but sat on the runway for 2 hours while the computers ""rebooted"". This delay of course caused us to miss our connection flight in Denver. Causing us to miss much of the first day activities. On our return flight we made it out of LAX on time on arrival in Denver it appears that our connection flight was on time. 30 min after we landed our flight was delayed for 5+ hours. No explanation was given to us. They did give us $15 food coupons 45 min before all restaurants closed ""after we had already paid for our meals"". Every gate in the Terminal had an unused plane sitting at it. Not any cheaper "" when you count baggage fees"" than any other carrier and I have never had so much trouble keeping a schedule. There was no weather in any part of the country by the way. We haven't made it on the delayed flight yet. Entirely possible that we didn't make the 3am flight either. Avoid at all cost.",Detractor
"Sadly I read these reviews of American Airlines, aircraft and route after I had booked. I can confirm what others say. Old planes, older cabin attendants and a Mickey Mouse type service by crew. No seat back entertainment centre, only central screen every 5/6 rows and programmes started before headsets even given out. Could hardly see the screens. Food absolutely terrible, especially on return leg to UK. Really cold on the flights. Our return flight was over the Atlantic when a warning light came on and the Captain returned to JFK. You could hear the alarm screeching in the background of his speech to the passengers. Escorted to stand by Fire Service after brakes checked. Second worst landing I have ever had in 45 years of flying. The landing in the replacement plane by the same pilot was only marginally better. The airline industry has moved on, especially the Middle East carriers, but American Airlines has not. I paid more for these 6/7 hour flights than I do for 14 hour flights to Asia. Pay a bit more and get a proper airline next time. Like many other reviewers on this and other sites, I will never use American Airlines again.",Detractor

"  New York JFK to DÃ¼sseldorf via London Heathrow. The online check-in was fast and easy. The choice of seats (free of charge) was very poor, even the plane was half-full. The check-in (baggage) organization in JFK was a mess. Long lines with no priority for members. You should arrive min 2hours before the boarding, otherwise you will miss your flight.

Recommendation to BA, staff behaved partly unacceptable. Beverages and seat comfort in total okay.",Passive
"  Mumbai to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. The planes are latest, the comforts are many, the gizmos are advanced, the staff look sophisticated, yet what is lacking is a little care and warmth. The A380 packs a lot of people but the service does not commensurate. For nearly 45 minutes services does not start and once the stewards come to your seat after a long wait you ask for as simple thing as a Ginger Ale for myself and my wife and they just give one saying that there is no stock. Also if you have a connecting flight there is no one at the airport to guide. The A380 Mumbai to Abu Dhabi flight on 20th January was bit delayed and by the time it arrived the boarding time for the connecting flight to Cairo already started. Given my experience with other airlines, I was hoping there would be someone after we come out from the flight to guide us to catch the connecting flight which might have aleady commenced boarding. There was none, the security is so crowded. I seek a help of one of the airport guys saying that I need help to reach the gate quickly to which he asks someone to help only to find that guy is busy over speaking on his mobile. Seeing that, the airline staff guides us to go through a lane that could clear the security fast and it was such a haste and hurry in the process forgot to pick up a few things that were put to security check. Since many passengers have a connecting flight, it is important that the airline and airport extend guidance and help instead of leaving them unattended and force them to scramble scurry all by themselves.",Passive

Our flight going over from JFK to Moscow was good as well as the food. However on the way back home from St. Petersburg is where all the problems started. Our original flight was delayed 12 hours which meant missing all our connections. We stood in line for 5 hours. The service at the airport was horrible. No one would help us get a flight. After many hours different lines talking to many representatives we made a call to our Travel Agent and the Emergency help number that we had. Only after these calls were we able to get another reservation home. The flight was fine but the on ground service is far from good or caring.,Passive
BKK-FRA-BKK Business class check in and boarding went smoothly on both legs. I was assigned seat 25K and was surprised to see that the FA drinks station was on the other side of the seat with no partition. It appears that rather than provide a decent work area in the rear of business class Thai have opted to jam in more seats and put the drinks station between the rear toilets and emergency escape door - not very well thought out at all. FA's were attentive and smiling but the food really is mediocre and needs improvement.,Passive
"  Christchurch to Sydney. What started promisingly turned into a nightmare. Left hotel at 4.30am for 7am flight to Sydney from Christchurch on 2 February. Check in fine though check in girl didn't smile and seemed unhappy to be there. Boarded plane on time and pushed back early.Then nothing - after what seemed an age the captain said that one of the engines seemed to be leaking fuel. They were going to run one of the engines and see if it stopped. After 1.5 hours on the plane we were told we would have to deplane We were given a 20 dollar voucher but only one cafe to spend it in, so the queue was enormous. The business lounge was reopened but very little food was available until lunchtime. No information was forthcoming, eventually our brother in law in Sydney told us that it was showing on the computer that the flight was leaving at 1540 but we had not been told this. Eventually it got round that it would now be 1640 but still nothing official to business class passengers - if announcements were made outside they were not conveyed to us. Eventually a woman told us at 3.00 pm that the flight was cancelled - no empathy, no real apology just that we had to reclaim our baggage and recheck in. No announcement was made where our baggage would be and no sign appeared on the belt, and eventually it appeared on a domestic carousel. Eventually we were called out of the queue and told we would be put on Emirates flight. For the first time the attitude was more appropriate. When we went back to the lounge as Emirates passengers, the same woman who had told us an hour previously our flight was cancelled appeared to have no recollection of that event. An airline needs to be judged how they manage things when they go wrong, and Qantas fell woefully short.",Detractor
LHR to Vienna on a mid afternoon flight onboard the Star Alliance 737-800. The mobile check-in service was easy and quicker yet the request for an aisle seat was not available despite earlier check-in. The flight was full and there was an overbooking meaning one passenger was unable to travel. A sandwich was served and two drinks also. The cabin seemed too hot during take-off however the temperature dropped as we reached cruising altitude. All the short haul fleet have been fitted with more comfortable stylish cabins and is a real plus side to the journey with Austrian. Overall a good journey.,Promoter
"  Brisbane to Singapore. This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats.",Promoter

Efficient boarding, seats 50J/K on upper deck, which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets. Mixed crew FAs and ours were young and enthusiastic. In-flight service good, with a notable improvement in the quality of food, i.e., courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp. IFE lagging behind that offered by competitors, with small screens and limited movies. Breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual.

"  I must say I was impressed by this airline. Although I had only two short flights inside New Zealand, they were both remarkable. Starting from the Check-In process (very smooth without any complicated steps), done via the mobile site and then obtaining the boarding pass in the App, using the check-in clients at the airport to print my own label for the luggage (with friendly assistance if needed), the whole flying process was delightful. There was even a question on the client machine if I would like my boarding pass printed or not. Because I had it already on the App I said no. I find this environmentally friendly. Then it is the uniforms of the flight attendances (Maori colourful style) and their smile that make you feel welcome. It really brings out the Kiwi hospitality that everybody talks about. Both flights landed ahead of schedule and while landing in Wellington we did have a lot of turbulences (problem known for this airport) and the plane was small, the pilots made a good job keeping us informed all the time. I really enjoyed the security video demonstration they have running right now, so original. They even serve you hot and cold beverages and a little snack for flights under 1h. The seats were comfortable enough and the legroom was decent. It really brings the pleasure of flying we are missing right now in Europe.",Promoter

NCE-BCN BCN-SVQ SVQ-NCE via BCN. While in Barcelona I receive an email telling me that my flight from Sevilla to Nice has changed but with no information on the nature of the change. In BCN on my way to SVQ I asked the Vueling information desk and they couldn't access my return flight information. In Sevilla I called again until I was told the flight I had booked had been cancelled. I had to stay an extra night in Sevilla at my expense so I could fly back one day later as scheduled. I paid 12 â‚¬ per leg for carrying my luggage in the hold however I noticed several passengers with large and heavy bags in the cabin. This makes you wonder about the policy. Like many low-cost airlines Vueling has leather seats and I don't like the feeling of sliding down on them. Although I would not recommend flying with Vueling they are very competitive in terms of fare and often the only choice on certain routes.,Detractor
"HKG-LAX B77W First Class. Transferred from a regional CX flight and was met at the arrival gate and escorted to a special transfer line for expedited security checking. The Wing First Class Lounge is excellent with attentive staff service good food/beverages and outstanding Cabanas. A second security check of hand luggage prior to boarding but the boarding lines could be better organized. On time departure. Four passengers in a cabin for six. The ""pre-refreshed"" interior (which I prefer to the latest colors) was well-preserved and clean. Staff friendly but lacked the standard of finesse expected on CX First Class especially when there were only four passengers. The hand-written welcome note on my tray was for another passenger until I pointed out their error. One flight attendant was very young and inexperienced and was unfamiliar with the wine choices available on the flight. The food served is of good quality and tasty but the menu is rather limited with main entrees that are not as good as served a couple of years ago. The AVOD system is outstanding and the seat very specious and private but not very comfortable for sitting in for 14+ hours though excellent for sleeping in the lie-flat position. On-time arrival at LAX but baggage took longer than expected for delivery. Overall I like the CX First Class product very much though I am concerned that standards are slipping slightly especially when some Asian and Middle East competitors are improving their product.",Passive
13/14 June 2014. CPT-DOH-LCA. First flight (CPT-DOH) on a new 787 I was very excited for my first flight on a Dreamliner but was rather disappointed by the poor seat pitch and width being 1.9m tall (6'2) I was very uncomfortable and unable to sleep the whole way. The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey. Luckily flight was only half full so I had an entire row to myself. Extremely good fare on entire trip.,Passive
"  With the exception of the pitiful food options which we were forced to eat after a disastrous transit through DFW, perhaps the best American Airlines flight I have taken flying from Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle. The plane was rammed as pretty much always but the saving grace was the seat back TV's with quality programming. As a family of 5 we don't have screens each, let alone travel with that many, as much as AA asserts that 90% of passengers do. Also benefitted from a very attentive and friendly FA who went out of her way to get me some milk, as opposed to cream, for my tea. Contrasting experience to 2 years ago on a flight with AA when I was literally scolded for asking that the cream not be put in to the hot water before a tea bag was put in. This was the 4th AA flight and 3 of those included FAs who were very much not part of the normal experience. Food options are seriously challenging for those unable to grab something before the flight. 4 of us opted for the $10 cheese platter which is about the best thing on offer. The other selected an overly loaded virtually inedible turkey and apple croissant sandwich.",Passive
" Stansted to Athens via Istanbul. Decided to give this airline a go because they had a fare for under Â£100 as a last-minute booking, with a 2 hour connection, compared to other airlines wanting double that. You can get the mobile boarding pass but there are issues with their app if you always dont have access to the internet. The boarding pass did not save down without you having to put in the booking reference each time and searching for it again which needs an internet connection. When i got to Istanbul i had no internet for my boarding pass but fortunately there was transfer desk who printed out a manual boarding card without a ounce of grief. I would recommend emailing your boarding passes until they sort this issue. Its very tight seating and the flight was full and the service was basic but i couldn't care less on a flight less than 4 hours. We got there and that's the main thing. Really overpriced food cart so make sure you stock up on your basic snacks. I thought that Istanbul Gokcen was a great airport to transit in great food court facilities and a cheeky way to stock up on cheap tobacco in transit back to Europe. The only thing i didn't care for was Stansted - worst airport that surrounds the London area. Hopefully they expand to Gatwick someday we need airline like this to keep the fares low.",Passive
 Hong Kong to Sydney. I generally prefer the Boeing 747-400 over other types of aircraft but sadly this one felt a bit worn. Seats were wide and there was plenty of legroom but felt hard mid-flight at the base due to wear. TV felt like it was tailored for my size but the icons on the buttons were rubbed off from years of use. The legrest did not seem to extend fully so I left it alone. Entertainment selection was good. In fact the default music channel was excellent - I never had to turn it down or change channel. Cabin service was not as good as previous flights and at times seemed irritable. There was plenty of overhead storage space but I did find the tiny seat storage pocket paradoxical.,Passive
Paphos - LGW 11th June. We had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from BA to confirm this. We arrived at Paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. BA had 3 check in counters open one of which was for Club Europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. We had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. I then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. After 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. The food options were OK but again not a great choice for veggies. The flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. We were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. Overall just an OK flight but BA's premier European product is somewhat underwhelming.,Passive

I sat down and right away noticed that the seat was quite narrow, however my table was in my arm rest, so that gave me even less space then everyone else. We were then delayed because of 'engine problems.' We then departed about 20 mins late. About an hour after we took off they served us our lunch which was quite good and I have to say I did enjoy it. For the rest of the flight I listened to music on my phone, and watched some interesting TV-shows. Then as the flight came to an end we were served a sausage wrap, which was spicy but also enjoyable. We arrived in Toronto 10 mins early and I have to say that the overall flying experience was average.",Passive

Their seats were more cramped than usual and they don't recline. The padding in the back of my seat was so thin and useless, I could feel the edge of the tray table from passenger traveling behind me. Spirit advertised this flight as leaving Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale in Florida and then onto San Jose, only they stopped at Texas first without advertising it - they also cancelled their plane for Texas to Phoenix on the return flight, so we had to stay a night in Texas.

I took an intercontinental return flight from Madrid to Havana. It was a daytime flight and except from the comfort of the seat this was an incredibly bad experience. The service was by far the worst service I've had in an airplane. The crew were very unfriendly and not co-operative at all. With dinner you'll get 1 drink. Apart from water or orange juice you have to buy all other drinks. The crew started serving food at a slow pace afterwards they came 3 times with coffee/tea and immediately afterwards the whole crew started to have dinner themselves. The stewards/stewardesses also didn't respond at all to the service lights you can switch on at you seat. I don't expect much from airplane food but this was one of the worst I've had. Air Europa also doesn't provide a personal entertainment system. It is still done by some general screens from the ceiling and was only broadcasting a movie in Spanish. Worst of all the movie was restarted 3 times and wasn't finished in the end. On the return way we had to wait an 1.5 hrs to get checked in. There was an enormous queue all the way through the departure hall. About half of the passengers still had to check in after us. So we asked for window seats (25% of the seats). We were told these weren't available anymore. So we asked for Aisle seats (50% of the seats). The ground stewardess told us she would fix this. In the end from the 10 people we were traveling with only 1 had an aisle seat and the rest were scattered through the whole plane on centre seats. Luckily this was a night flight and we were all tired. So we slept most of the way and didnt have to deal with the service or Spanish movie. The food was of the same standard again: really bad.,Detractor

"I've flown with Spirit Airlines many times during the last several months, and on no single occasion did I encounter the complete breach of trust and lack of professionalism than I did today (8/24/15). After purchasing a ticket and confirming my seat, at least a few weeks prior to my flight, I arrived at the airport to complete one part of my travels (DTW-IAH, Flight 939). I chose the early flight to IAH as I was scheduled to assist my daughter with moving into campus housing. The evening prior to the flight I received a call and from Spirit indicating that the scheduled plane was being downsized and that they were seeking volunteers to offer their seats in exchange for an updated flight and a roundtrip ticket to any supported destination. I contacted them to confirm that I wanted to keep my scheduled flight. The Rep assured me that no change would be made to my reservation. I arrived at DTW and upon arriving at the gate (D12), 40 minutes prior to departure, I waited next to the Gate Desk to provide staff with my boarding pass. After several minutes Gate Agents began to call the names of several passengers, informing them that they could board. I again waited for a few minutes, then asked if I could board, to which the Gate Agent responded by indicating that my Check-In Number was ###. It was at this point that I asked her to explain what that means and she stated that passengers were being confirmed for travel based on the order that they Checked-In, without regard to Confirmed Ticket Purchase/Seat Confirmation. While I don't take issue with the fact that flights are often altered, downsized, cancelled etc.. I do take issue with the fact that Spirit Airlines accepted payment for the flight, premium seat and took possession of my luggage, then violated our agreement by giving my seat to another passenger without my consent and refused to allow me to board.",Detractor

"  Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda return. I had the chance to fly American's international product on the new Boeing 787. I especially liked the shade less windows that lighten or darken as desired. Seat pitch for Main Cabin Extra was 34"" with comfortable seats. Food was decent with good beverage service, and snacks available through the flight at the self service galley area. Two totally different crew teams though, on the trip to HND the crew was outstanding, it looked like they were making an effort to break the stereotype that prevails about American carrier labor, not the same on the return when I experienced the stiffness attitude and ""can't do that"" persona. I was left with a very positive opinion about the Boeing 787 and the Main Cabin Extra leg space. One last observation, there was some confusion upon boarding at HND for the return trip to LAX.",Promoter

TLV-ADD-LOS. B737-800. TLV-ADD 1am departure. You would think they would be in a rush to serve the food and let everyone sleep. Not so. Lights turned on after takeoff for a lengthy 2 hours to serve dinner to a half full flight. Only 2 FA's in Y class. Bathrooms in the back not stocked. Constant lines I can't imagine when it's full. Only 2 toilets for a whole cabin. FA's very nice and gentle. Very good selection of drinks and very generous. Food tasty. ADD-LOS on ancient B767-300. Gate was changed twice and hundreds of people were running from gate to gate in the mad rush that ADD airport is early in the morning. Last minute aircraft change caused chaos with seat changes and passengers were still standing looking for open seats when the plane was already taxiing. Good food attentive gentle service again generous bar service. After touch down in Lagos passengers were getting up opening overhead bins while plane was still taxiing.

" Newark to Phoenix. This was the worst airline I've ever flown. My husband and I were not seated together I was in row 28 and he was in row 38 with 2 gentlemen of about 7 ft tall. They were father and son basketball players the son with ASU. My husband was bruised on his foot by the lack of room in the seats. The bathrooms were locked for the first hour while the inept crew attended a woman with a seizure probably due to the excessive heat in the cabin. Another woman threw up and there was no cart service for the first half of the trip. When I spoke to the crew about the heat that was so bad most people were spillled over into the aisle as the seats were suffocating. I was told to turn on my air vent which was fully open. Duh! We were instructed to only use the bathroom in our assigned cabin, once they were finally open. The access to the bathroom was obstructed by the stretched out legs of the 7 ft man who should never been moved to the last row where the seat room is mallet due to airline design and lack of reclining seats although the row in front reclines into thenpassengers face",Detractor

JEDâ€“RUH operated by B777-200 in high density seating configuration with only 2 rows of First Class and the rest Economy in a 3x4x3 layout with a LCC style seat pitch. Most B777s in Economy have a 3x3x3 seating layout and the extra seat therefore results in narrower seats and aisles. This is perhaps acceptable for short haul domestic flights such as this was but this would be almost unacceptable for medium / long haul flights. Somewhat incredibly a hot meal was served in Economy on this 1h 10m flight â€“ a choice of Mixed Grill or Pasta with pitta bread a cake and a Mars Bar. Water came within the Meal Box whilst soft drinks were offered separately along with tea and coffee afterwards. The flight crew were the usual Asian multi- nationals who were efficient professional and cheerful. The flight left on time and arrived early â€“ and all for US$ 75.,Passive

"Took a flight from Phoenix to Lima Peru for $650 (beating the $1300 on United - the next best option). Took every precaution and planned ahead (pre-paid carry on printed tickets at home brought my own snacks etc). Didn't pay extra for assigned seating and still ended up sitting next to my travel partner. Had 2 layovers - one in Dallas and one in Ft. Lauderdale neither one was delayed nor got cancelled. Maybe I just got beginner's luck and had no issues with my flights and didn't have to deal with their customer service? Seat comfort (or lack of) will be my biggest complaint - domestic flights are extra firm and do not recline but the international flight to Peru and back was like any other economy seating you'd find on regular planes that have more cushion and do recline. After my flight experience to Peru I opted to pay for a window seat on the return flight so I can be slightly more ""comfy"". I do recommend this airline for short trips - I probably won't make another 10+ hour trip because seats are just too uncomfortable. Do your research and read the small print on the Spirit website. The website clearly states exactly what you will need to purchase ahead of time and what you will get charged if you don't. I've flown other budget airlines like JetStar and Tigerair in Asia and they pretty much operate the same way - they don't charge you what you don't use that's why tickets are so cheap!",Passive

Flew between BNE and HAN/SGN via BKK on Thai Airways. The Boeing 777 had a nice clean interior and had spacious leg room perfect for the long nine hour flight between Australia and Thailand. Flight Attendants were nice enough and were quick to respond to passenger requests. IFE had a decent selection of new movies and TV shows enough to entertain me throughout both long-haul flights. Unfortunately on the return journey my screen went dead five hours in and there was nothing that could be done to fix it leaving me to watch the remaining half of my movie on my friend's screen. Between BNE and BKK food was plentiful and tasty however on both of the shorter flights the 'cold lunchbox style' food was really quite bad and a little inedible. Disappointing. With this being said I did enjoy all flights with Thai and would recommend for long haul flights. In terms of standard just a little below other Asian carriers such as Singapore and Cathay.,Passive
" Edmonton to Zihuatanejo. Leaving Edmonton, check in was unorganized, understaffed, and ridiculously slow. Boarding was late, probably due to terrible check in as well. Plane on way back ran out of fuel and had to divert to Calgary. Little to no info from Sunwing handed out. Told there was a rep and baggage carousel, nope, had to go through Customs, and still no Sunwing rep. Calgary white hat people were trying to help but it was obvious they knew it was Sunwing and they would be dealing with it. Was told to go back to departures and wait there. Waited close to an hour with still no rep in sight. Got frustrated and went and booked a WestJet flight instead to get home. I understand that mistakes can be made (running out of fuel) but to have nobody helping or assisting customers on a mistake made by your Airline is totally unacceptable. Sunwing is a low budget Airline cutting corners and should be avoided as they see no value in assisting customers. Flight was originally set for 20:45 in YEG, landed in YYC instead, and found out later delayed until 10:45 next morning for YEG. I am sure that would have been a fun night with maybe 5 hrs sleep for the families and other customers. Not sure if they got a hotel or had to stay in Airport.

I was not given noise cancelling headphones and was left with the awful headphones that AC gives out for free to economy class.

" . I booked to fly with Lufthansa from London to Zagreb via Frankfurt on a Wednesday evening. The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was unable to act without their ticking a box on the system. I spent the night on the floor of the airport. I emailed Lufthansa that night expressing my frustration and requesting compensation.

Without a doubt the worst airline we have used. They will rip you off seven ways to Sunday and twice on Monday. We booked our flight via Priceline and were never told that in order not to be raked over the coals in baggage fees we needed to pay for our bags in advance. When we learned this at the airport while checking in it cost $90 for two bags - she never even told us there was an additional fee for the checked bag we had despite telling her that we had one. We were told that had we booked with Spirit directly we would not have had to pay as much. What they neglected to tell us was that when we paid for the return bags online in advance that we needed to do it more than 24 hours before the return flight or suffer near equally outlandish fees. Furthermore when trying to pay for them in advance via the iPad apparently their poor software cannot handle such a simple transaction yet when you call to take care of it over the phone you can't or you'll have to pay the same amount as you would if you checked them at the airport!,Detractor
"First time to use Lufthansa new Premium Economy on this long 12 hr flight to Cancun. The seat comfort is a mayor plus compared to the standard Economy Class. Nowadays there are so many Premium Economy or Economy Plus concepts that you don't know what to expect. Lufthansa has done a great job. It's an almost independent class with very comfy seats. The seat offers 18 cm more legroom, is wider and has a relatively big tray table (comparable to that one in Business Class), power sockets and IFE on high definition touch screens. The service was very professional, friendly and efficent. The purser of this flight welcomed us personally. On this A340 the Premium Economy consists of only 19 seats and has it's own compartment. It is quiet and you can deboard quickly after arrival. The food is almost the same than in Economy Class, but served on china and with a menu and some real glasses. After boarding you get a non-alcoholic juice cocktail. Food quality and quantity was fine. You get plenty of drinks. IFE and WIFI worked also really good. At your seat there is a water bottle and nice amenity kit. The flight was almost one hour ahead of schedule. It was a great experience.

CDG-FLR on an A318. The flight was firstly late due to a technical issue with the plane. We waited on the tarmac with most of the doors open in the 3' C weather for about 45 mins. The food was atrocious. First of all is it too much of a luxury for AF to provide actual milk instead of powdered milk with their tea and coffee? The meal was a little sugary cheese something bun which was barely edible. The configuration of the plane was a little odd with small narrow and pretty uncomfortable seating with a very wide aisle. The staff were friendly enough but the IFE was non-existent. For a full service airline I thought that this flight was pretty poor. I would probably fly AF if I got a good price but for most routes you can probably get a comparable level of service on a low cost airline for much less.,Passive

"My wife and I recently traveled Melbourne-Hong Kong return with Cathay Pacific. Having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy (PE), not a good decision. Our problems started when checking in at Melbourne airport. Although booked as Mr and Mrs, we were advised that we were not sitting together. After some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. However, on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together, actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. Notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. On previous flights with other airlines, domestic and international, we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. The dinner meal choices were very limited. There was actually only one choice, as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the PE section. In addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. When combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that Cathay Premium Economy class is anything more than a more expensive â€˜economy' ticket with a somewhat larger seat. Lots of â€˜economy' and not a lot of â€˜premium'. While performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered, in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago. Based on our recent experience I would not recommend Cathay Pacific â€˜Premium Economy' it does not represent value for money.",Passive

Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes.

When we got to Bangkok I noticed at baggage claim that my wallet was gone. I went into stress overload mode. Then we found out that the China Southern staff had found it on the plane and turned it into their office in the Bangkok airport. This all happened before I even knew the wallet was gone.

Again, service by the cabin attendants was superb, complementing the quality and variety of meals. We look forward to our return flights.",Promoter
"  Flew Stockholm to London. This airline has an almost non existent customer service, if you should ever have any issues with your booking. I tried to recover money for over 1 year when they charged me 3 times for one ticket. I probably spent near 6 hours on recovering the money. Regarding the actual flying. The staff are usually nice but it's a low price airline experience. With the only difference that SAS usually have older planes and more expensive food. I only recommend flying SAS if there is no other alternative. I have flown SAS a lot and is a gold tier traveller as Star Alliance. Norwegian and Easyjet are far better than SAS, but Ryanair is possibly worse, however at a fraction of the price.",Detractor
"Air India is the worst airline I have experienced in years, would never book this airline again. Don't trust the customer care details, they don't know about the information they are giving.

" I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around Â£150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said she'd take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. I'll never fly with them again.",Detractor

"Flew from Hong Kong to San Fran and around the US in late May. I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a low' cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since. Your people are your business.",Detractor
14th October Manchester to Ibiza 06.15 left on time and arrived just 5 minutes late which is an exception for Ryanair as I travel with them about 6-7 times a year. The plane was a quarter full and the service basic but the cabin crew did their job professionally. I will keep using Ryanair because their prices are extremely hard to match and their rules are simple just read the terms and conditions and be patient too many people criticise them because they don't know any different well done Ryanair once again and thank you! 1000 miles of air travel for Â£25.99 is a huge bargain!,Promoter

"We were very frequent Southwest Airlines business flyers of what was the best airline in the sky. Never leaving late, fun attentive service and never leaving late (did I mention that). Our last 5 flights over the last 3 months had 1 on time and the others between 1 and 3 hours late. This has been getting worse for the last 2 years and now so prevalent we will be shopping other airlines. No more fun, funny staff. They're not bad, just like the rest of the airlines. But not knowing when the plane will get to the destination just doesn't cut it. Lateness and cancellations galore. On the plus side, they still have the best luggage and change policy but it's now being trumped by the deficits. Often their prices range from the best to the worst on scheduled routes.

"  BNE-HKG-BNE, December and January with Cathay Pacific Airways. Unable to choose seats at booking, or later on, except by paying exorbitant fees, where almost all seat selections were blocked. No value in that. Seat selection at online check-in, has more choices (?!) and is free. Bag drop not open until 1/2 hour after check-in at airport counter! Makes no sense and bag drop line very long and slow. Flight delayed for an hour, with no announcement, until 10 min after scheduled time. Seats on A350 thin and uncomfortable. I felt every bump and push from the passenger behind me. The entertainment system was frustrating to use, touch screen not responsive, requiring multiple swipes to make it work. Content was average. The food was dreadful, bland, with an odd texture. As for the breakfast, who knows what the liquid sloshing in the bottom of the tray was. Announcements by cabin staff on HKG-BNE flight difficult to understand (if at all), with pauses and stumbling over words, not proffessional. I had thought Cathay Pacific was a quality airline, and was not impressed. I've had better on ""low cost"" airlines.",Detractor
"Istanbul to Washington. I've flown business class on Turkish Airlines many times, and almost on every flight it's the same experience. Airport, lounges, seats, and entertainment system are good, but service is mediocre or bad, ie. boarding process, through the flight, and customer service. On this flight, boarding was messy and chaotic. Once we took off I tried to watch a movie but the screen kept shifting between modes and disrupting the movie. The attendant had no idea what to do. He tried restarting but that didn't fix anything. He didn't offer any apologies or even a fake attempt to compensate through special courtesy service. One good aspect was free wi-fi for business class travelers. I must say that's a feature that I was immensely thankful for especially with my malfunctioning screen. And the wi-fi worked without a hitch throughout the flight. Turkish Airlines may aspire to be a top-tier airlines, but its service is far from reaching that level.",Passive
" London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. So Etihad have entered the race to the bottom in style. Simply avoid regardless of price. They no longer bother with pre-dinner drinks, the drinks trolley only came by once on both legs of my flight.

Menus are gone, so is a side salad, cheese, decent cutlery, oh and no butter with bread!? Dessert is served after with tea or coffee, and then that is the last you will see of any staff. There is no longer a second meal service instead there is a menu where you can but food and drink 'Ryanair' style, and its all rubbish. The staff look as tired as the Boeing 777's do.

" Houston to Los Angeles. I've flown Spirit many times. From Los Angeles to Vegas, New York, Seattle, etc. I am always able to pack a rather large bag as my carry on and measure it to make sure it fits within their requirements as a ""personal item"", so it's always free. I always fly with wife and son and they bring their own bags as well, for free. Depending on the type of year and destination, Spirit can be hundreds of dollars cheaper than any other airline. Also because I never check in a bag I never have to wait in line, use the self serve kiosk and you're done in a few minutes. The staff has always been helpful, professional, and friendly. I take a stroller with me, which is also free and they check it in for me at the gate as I'm getting ready to board. You do have to pay $7 to be able to choose your seats or you can let them choose. We've always let them choose and all 3 of us have always sat together. They don't have in flight entertainment but that helps keep the tickets so cheap - that's less money that they need to spend. I also love how they have the fake leather seats, I feel it's much more sanitary than the cloth seats. I've never had an issue with Spirit. There was one time my flight got delayed due to weather but you know what, It happens. And the delay was maybe 2 hours. For everyone complaining that they couldn't get their money back for a missed flight, etc. It just sounds like you didn't take advantage of the $13 warranty that they offer.

" After the last time I flew Virgin, I promised myself I wouldn't do it again but my travel companion convinced me otherwise so I gave Virgin another chance. Unfortunately, my trip back home was more unsatisfactory. Upon purchasing a small meal pack (I'm guessing the options were limited since it was only a 1.25 hour flight) and a cocktail, we were the last ones served (last seats on the plane). I feel as though delivering purchased products would be more of a priority. Perhaps assigning one person to deliver products while the other offers complimentary drinks would be more effective for customer service and efficiency. Maybe operationally that doesn't work for them because of cost but it compromises service. After receiving our order, the steward forgot an item and when I said excuse me and tried to tell her, she turned and said ""you have to wait"". I completely understand that but the way she said it was in a tone and look that I could only receive as annoyance. It was as if I was a nuisance to her. After reaching the back of the plane, I could hear loudly the other steward complaining and bad mouthing about a gentleman who wanted 2 diet cokes. I understand people talk shop but wow, in ear shot of other guests? We only received our purchases after the plane started to descend and before we knew it, we were forced to give up our purchased wine and cocktail. When my companion said ""I didn't even get to finish. I'm going to get a refund."" The steward retort with a ""you do that"". All I could think, and pardon the language, was ""what the heck?"". I have worked in customer service for over a decade, and this is by far the most unprofessional group of employees I have ever encountered. They were rude, unpleasant and just seemed so unhappy. Perhaps they are not suited for this kind of work but the airline needs to acknowledge that.",Detractor
I was travelling with my teenage son and 3 others on a flight to Boston. We received excellent service from everyone.

Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms.

" Paris to Bangalore. Air France takes off, flies, lands. Expect no more. If you get the edible food you like (or have pre ordered) and your checked in baggage, it is a bonus. If you are expecting courteous service just forget Air France. Even in business class you are treated like a piece of you know what. I can only shudder to think of the folks who travel in economy on this ghastly airline. Even though the baggage is marked as priority it is just a consolation for the eyes. Once my baggage got delayed and the ground handlers had no clue whether the baggage made it or not and had to wait for the last bag (remember it was a priority baggage). At times the priority baggage is mixed up with the usual baggage so you wait forever to collect them. My recommendations if you travel Air France, carry cabin baggage only, bring your own food if possible, bring your own travel assistant or hostess who will look after you on the flight.",Detractor
"  People who complain about Spirit are people who are looking for a full flying experience. Spirit was cheap, and if you properly take your time to read, you would see that if you pay online for your checked bag or carry on you save money and if you print out your boarding pass at home takes 2 minutes and saves money. Take an empty water bottle if you don't want to pay $3 for water. You don't have to pay for a seat if you let Spirit randomly assign where you sit when you print out your boarding pass. I fly alone so this isn't a problem. And if you want to sit beside a friend/family member, seats are only $8 to guarantee you sit together. Unless you are a very tall or wide person, the seats are completely fine. There's no movies or Wifi but take a book to read or play a game on your phone. The plane was extremely clean, the staff was friendly and willing to help, flights were on time - some even leaving a little early. Boarding was pushed back slightly but the plane still departed on time (actually a few minutes early).

"My ratings below are from previous flights with Frontier Airlines. I used to be one of their premier customers, but when all their extra fees hit, I went back to United. However, when a company hired me and paid for a ticket with Frontier in March 2016, I was happy to try them again. After trying to check in at a kiosk, I was told I needed to see an agent. After an hour in line, the agent said I might be denied boarding. I waited another hour in the security line. At the gate, I was told to wait, so I waited another 45 minutes. The flight was oversold, and I was bumped. I went to customer service with two others who were ""involuntarily denied boarding,"" and I learned the airline is required to offer a stipend to anyone would would like to give up his or her seat (""No one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing""). I heard no announcements. Subsequently, I missed a presentation that meant a great deal to me. I was told I would be ""automatically reimbursed"" for my ticket - which was not true as reimbursement required an hour on the phone with an agent in the Philippines, and I was paid what a friend calls a ""kiss-off fee."" The others bumped from the flight received a lunch voucher and found seats on a United flight that night at a higher cost. I went home. Never again. Absolutely never again.",Detractor

" I would like to share the horrible experience that I had flying with American Airlines. I bought tickets from them to travel from Toronto to Houston and return. Toronto to Chicago to Houston (01/24/2018) Houston to Dallas to Toronto (01/29/18) The flight from Toronto to Houston was ok except for an hour delay. Everything turned into a nightmare when we were travelling back from Houston. Our flight from Houston was at 4:20PM (45 mins flight to Dallas) and our connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto was at 6:25PM (2hr 25 mins to Toronto). We got on the flight at 4:20 and we were stuck there for almost 1.5 hrs. According to the captain the air control did not give clearance and the plane had to refuel since it did not plan for the delay. After 1.5 hours they informed that we will not be able to catch our connecting flight from Dallas so it's better to get off and re-book from Houston. We got off and asked to get our checked-in luggage. They said they cannot take that out and it will be going to Dallas. So we asked them what our options were since do not want to lose our luggage. During this time we got the notification that our flight was re-booked from Dallas at 7AM the next day (01/30/18), which meant we had to stay the night at Dallas. After discussing at the gate and with the flight crew they confirmed us that since we have a check-in baggage it will be better for us to go to Dallas and as it was an airline issue, accommodation will be provided for the night. We were convinced and agreed to get in the flight again and go for Dallas where we reached at 6:57PM (instead of 5:37PM) This is where everything started. After getting off the plane we went to talk to gate staff (as instructed) for our accommodation voucher and that is when they said ""Since it is not our fault, we will not be able to provide accommodation. In our system we see that it is coded for Tarmac delay due to clearance from Air Control which led to refueling"". We told them repeatedly that we were took off that plane and put back in and assured that there will be accommodation provided. We just had to talk to the gate. After that they said, ""Well sir, I do not see anything documented/coded in your account, therefore I cannot do anything. The best we can do is provide you hotels at distress rate"" The minimum amount of distress rate they offered was USD 65 without shuttle and if we wanted shuttle it would USD 75. Why would we pay anything? Was it our fault? We did not take their offer and the funny thing is the hotel we ended up staying â€œDays Inn hotelâ€ was available on Booking.com for USD 65 with shuttle service. I do not know what kind of distress rate were they offering. You can find a copy of my hotel receipt below. We spent almost 2.5 hours travelling from Houston to Dallas and hearing them say that just made us frustrated and speechless. We were supposed to be at work the next day on 01/30/2018, so which meant 1 extra day leave from work.",Detractor

Will not be flying with United again after lack of accommodation.",Detractor
Flights on time. For dinner the last meal available had something that I was intolerant of. They managed to find me a crew meal that saved the day. What was strange was the timing of the meals. Dinner was served about 5pm departure time. Breakfast was about 5am departure time. My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.,Promoter
" Flew Sydney to Denpasar. An absolute sub-standard product on this route. Such a small aircraft for a 6 hour flight. The leg room on this aircraft is unacceptable for an international, full service product. I believe you would have a better experience if you flew Jetstar, Qantas' budget arm, on this route, as they use a B787. I would not reccomenend using Qantas on this route, unless they upgraded the aircraft to a A330, as they use on their Jakarta and Singapore routes. Unless this aircraft switch happens, I'll be sticking with Garuda Indonesia moving forward.",Detractor

Having read so many negative comments about Vueling I was quite sceptical when I was about to board Vueling from Rome to Athens. Well it was nothing like what I geared myself for. The plane was on time. The boarding was orderly luggage was checked in and reclaimed without a hitch. The cabin crew were polite and the plane ride was smooth. So just gonna give my 2 cents that it was good service and met most of my expectations. The only bone I have to pick would be the leg space. Thank you Vueling for making my Europe trip perfect!,Promoter

"I flew American Airlines from Charleston, SC to Hartford, CT with a connection in Washington D.C. Once I arrived in DC we were told the plane would be delayed 2 hours (originally supposed to leave at 10:10pm) to 12:01am due to maintenance problems with our plane coming from Portland, ME. Once the plane arrived at 11:45 they rushed us all onboard and then sat there for 40 minutes on the tarmac. Finally the captain came on and said due to more ""maintenance issues"" (but never specified) that they were ""trying to decide"" what to do - either switch us to a whole other plane or call to repair it. After about another 40 minutes of sitting a few of us starting to receive emails that the flight had been canceled all together. It is sad how Orbitz sent me an email quicker than they could tell me! After a 2 hour delay and 1.5 hours on the plane they finally canceled. But it gets better! With 70 of us and 1 woman at the service desk (who was very nice and trying her best!) we were told the only options were to wait until 11pm the next day (almost a full 24 hours) for a direct flight or take a flight to Chicago and have a 6 hour layover until Hartford. Due to myself being a clinician I could not afford to miss that much time, so I ended up taking a flight to White Plains, NY and drove myself to Hartford with a rented car! I wouldn't say I'm a frequent flyer, but I do fly a few times a year, and coincidently this was my first time flying American and also my worst experience ever! The flight crew had a ""don't care"" attitude and were not accommodating at all. The gentlemen next to me, after being on the plane for an hour, asked for some water to which she replied ""I'll have to ask the captain, but I can't be getting everyone beverages"" - surprise he never got the water, and when the captain came on the first time he said ""Sorry everyone for the slight delay in getting you out."" 3 hours isn't a slight delay! I can understand trying to be humorous but at 1 in the morning when we all have lives to get back to it came off as just crude! I get that everyone, especially the crew, is tired. But it is times like that where the customers need some extra care and accommodation - every little thing helps! In the future I will try everything in my power not to fly American Airlines!",Detractor
"We recently flew Frontier Airlines from Chicago to Vegas and back. We had flown in 2013 with Frontier and were surprised they now charge $30 for one carry on. Also, it seems all the seats have been changed with less padding. Less than an inch of padding in backs and seat, which makes for a very uncomfortable flight. The tray tables are half the size of a normal tray. The staff on the flight were rude and unprofessional. I am anxious on flights, and watch crew a lot. The fight attendants seemed frantic. At one time the co pilot spent 20 min outside the cockpit chatting with a stewardess. Very unprofessional!",Detractor
London Heathrow to Hong Kong and back economy both ways. Flew on the last 747 service from London to Hong Kong on 31st December 2013. We were all given a lovely commemorative postcard set at the gate. As we taxied a firetruck water canon salute was in operation although the fact that it was pouring with rain rather spoiled the effect! Seats were reasonably comfortable and although I know others find these older style 'sliding' recline Cathay Pacific seats not so comfortable at least you don't get problems with the person in front if you reclining their seat all the way back. Food was nothing special neither was the movie selection and crew not the most attentive I was expecting Cathay Pacific in-flight service to be up there with the other major Asian airlines and so was a little disappointed. Return flight Hong Kong to Heathrow was on a 777. It may be my 'shape' but I just could not get comfortable in these seats (economy class) and unlike the old style 747 seats the new 777 seats recline by tilting and so inevitably the person in front of me decided to recline fully for the entire flight. This combined with the uncomfortable seat (no lumbar support and either very low armrests or high seat cushion - I couldn't work out which) made it one of the most unpleasant long haul flights I have taken in recent years. Cabin crew not friendly (aside from one female cabin attendant who seemed to be doing more work than all her colleagues and who was genuinely personable and friendly) and as on the outward leg cabin crew not especially attentive. Very relieved to land at LHR and get off this flight. Disappointed with Cathay Pacific given their generally very positive reputation.,Passive
CPH-GOT-STO-CPH all on SK. Planes were clean and all flights on time and uneventful so SK delivered the basics OK. A cup of coffee was offered on all flights in SAS GO.

"Like I indicated below - nothing but excellent. Flew from LAX to Mokba and back. Very outstanding service. Check in easy quick and efficient. The food flying back from Mokba was very good. Sat in the first row right were the bathrooms are and was very impressed how ALL flight attendants were constantly checking and cleaning the bathrooms (our American airlines should really take notice of that. Their bathrooms are not clean - to say the least). Also the flight stats are throughout the whole flight very nicely displayed - including nearest towns at what direction and distance - never saw that with our airlines. It also shows ""pilot view"" of take-off and landing - loved that. Actually could recognize all people on the ground shortly before touch down watching the descending airplane at LAX with flashes going off like crazy. In the future I will try to book Aeroflot wherever available.",Promoter
"We were 2 pax traveling Oslo to Luanda via Brussels. We did have some negative vibes after having read some reviews but the connection was good and price attractive. Turned out to be a wrong choice. It started out with an overbooked flight from Oslo and an advice that one of us would have to stay behind. Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help. In my 40 years of intercontinental travel, I've experienced worse seats but that was a long time ago.",Detractor

"  Hamburg to Amsterdam. I was very dissapointed with the way I was treated by the crew, specially by a lady from the cabin crew. The flight was delayed, which can happen. But how hard is it to give the people waiting in line a heads up? Then by entering the plane it was hard for the crew to great their customers. I greeted them in their language and asked if there maybe was any room for my suitcase (which was the size it was allowed to be). The answer was no. I asked what I was supposed to do. She said in a very unpolite way that it could be packed downstairs. I was a little bit shocked by the impoliteness of the crew. If you become a cabin crew I think one of the first things you learn is to be polite! It was not my fault that the flight was delayed.",Detractor

Copa is not my first choice of carriers for flights to Central and South America for several good reasons. Ground personnel are most often rude indifferent and intolerant of individual needs. Many choose not to understand passengers who need assistance in English. I do speak Spanish which is a good thing when checking in because the agents will invariably try to charge you extra baggage fees for oversized or overweight baggage and seldom back down. The airline has a horrible record for on time departures. Onboard don't expect much in the way of amenities the cabin is more akin to a domestic first class cabin. Seats on the 738 fleet are all leather with a comfortable seat pitch and a comfortably wide width. However they are old recliner type seats with only a slight recline - but even that feature is commonly in a state of disrepair. AV equipment on board is very old with some aircraft's still featuring the overhead small TV screens every few rows. Audio choices are very limited when they function. The upside are the inflight crews who are friendly professional and very apologetic about the state of the cabin equipment. Food and drinks are reliably good and the flight deck crews are just as good as the inflight crews. Business class fares are usually a fraction of what the other carriers charge so book it only for the added bonus of extra seat space and check your high expectations at the counter along with your bags - which may or may not arrive with you at your final destination.,Passive
Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau.

"  Melbourne to Colombo via Hong Kong. We boarded as usual on time. We made ourselves comfortable and sat within the aircraft for over 30min without any information provided by the crew. At last the captain made an announcement that there are technical flaws with the aircraft and that he has no choice but to cancel the flight. So all passengers were taken off the flight and once in the ground we were informed that they intend to transfer us to a Qantas flight to depart 3 hours later. I had a 4 hour transit at Hong kong prior to my next flight to Colombo and when I mentioned this to the ground staff they were quiet assuring that I would be there on time to catch my next flight. 3 hours passed and they picked a few passengers ""randomly"" to have the previledge of flying the Qantas flight while the rest of us kept sitting in patience. When inquired as to what is going on the ground staff replied ""sir we have got permission only for limited passengers and so we picked a few randomly."" So what happens to the rest? The answer was that the rest would be flying through Cathay Pacific in their next scheduled departure which was 8 hours after our original departure time. No lounges were provided, just food coupons. Then time passed and we were at last on board a flight, landed in Hong kong having missed my connecting flight. We were informed that all passengers to Colombo will be flown to Singapore and then from Singapore to Colombo via Sri lanka Airlines. All in all we arrived in Colombo 18 hours after our original arrival time and to find out that our luggages have not arrived with us. It was a horrible service with poor customer service.",Passive

BOS-LAX 738. Boarding was fairly efficient. They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10.,Promoter

I must commend the work of the senior flight steward who took excellent care of his passengers and came to check on them every few hours. The meals were average, not necessarily the best.

AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering.

But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered.

"  On our flight to Paris from Los Angeles, neither movie monitor worked. Not only did they not work, both were stuck ""on"" so you had bright monitor lights shining in your faces while trying to sleep. It could not be shut off. Then seat 85K would not recline at all, it was broken. So, once the plane's cabin lights were dimmed and everyone around us was asleep, we were left with monitor lights in our eyes and one seat would not recline. I have a bad back so this only made it worse. The plane was full so there were no available seats for us to move. At one point, a flight attendant tried to tape a magazine over the monitors.... only to have them fall off into our laps 20-30 minutes later. These premium economy seats were $2700 more than coach seats, yet they were horrible and an unpleasant start to our vacation. The folks in economy watched movies and their seats reclined.

Nothing more, nothing less. Well, this might be a good thing to a frequent flyer, but in our lifetime, we will never have enough mileage, with or without their offering, to earn anything. So the mileage offering was nothing to us. This was a once in a lifetime vacation so we paid the extra money for the upgraded seats, only to have these indicated issues. There is no skin off Delta's nose to handling the complaint. I got the usual ""this is the best we can do"" response. Despite my repeated emails to Delta about this poor offering, they will do no more. The flight back home, two weeks later was great. Monitors worked and the seats reclined, but needless to say, we started off horrible on Air France and it took 3-4 days for the aggravated back issues to subside. If this is how Air France feels, then I'd opt for another airline. And, if Delta is handling the complaints for them, I suspect they would be just as bad. Find another airline besides Air France and Delta. They are not the only ways to fly!",Detractor

The attendants were attentive through out the trip without compromising my privacy. The only improvement I wish to see in the near future is WiFi availability.",Promoter
"11th April SU0260 Moscow-Tokyo. 21st April SU261 Tokyo-Moscow. Flew on a Airbus A330 from Tokyo to Amsterdam through Moscow. First time Aeroflot but never again. A list of disappointments: All announcements were in 3 languages: Russian English and Japanese even the sales and priority rewards announcements. During the 9 hour flight we only got a cold drink once(!) even during dinner we didn't get anything to drink other than coffee or tea afterwards. This was a day flight and I didn't sleep so I didn't miss anything I'm sure. 1.5 hour delay which is perfectly acceptable for me but don't let us board and tell us every 5 minutes that the delay will be an extra 5 minutes (and in 3 languages again). The sign ""fasten seatbelts"" was lit for 3/4 of the flight but I didn't feel any turbulence at all seemed like the stewards didn't want people to stretch their legs. Very outdated multimedia system no subtitles available. Stewards refuse to speak English and explains everything in Russian constantly.",Detractor
"  Flew Wellington to Hong Kong via Auckland. Due to the Auckland airport fuel crisis (damaged pipes) the plane had to stopover in Australia to refuel fully (as many other airlines did). During the stopover which delayed the flight about 45 minutes on arrival the crew were very good, constantly offering water, coffee, tea and light snacks as we were not allowed to exit the aircraft. In the air the meal options were very good and were good for both majorities on board (Hong Kong Citizens and New Zealand Citizens) with Asian and European style meals available to suit everybody. The inflight entertainment was good, but it was still the same from when I flew to Sydney in April and July, making it hard to find something I would like that I hadn't already watched. Boarding was prompt and everything was done in an orderly fashion. Crew were extremely friendly and did their absolute best to make sure everybody was seen to in the entire flight.

Airline did not inform us about the check-in relocation which was the domestic wing of an unfinished new terminal. There the check-in was longer but it could not be helped due to the missing equipment for the staff based in an unfinished terminal. Boarding the A333 was pleasant first time boarding one since improvement of their airline their aircraft usually serves medium-haul flights and the airplane feels spacious despite a high seating capacity that could've made seat comfort difficult.

"I am a regular traveler between Dubai and Los Angeles and notice if there is any improvements made on this route since the last trip in June 2015. Overall journey was pleasant, departure was nearly half-an-hour late due to offloading luggage of passengers who could not travel that day, but the captain promised to make up the time lost throughout the flight. Arrival was on time as scheduled. A380 a joy to travel in. What could be better is if the departure gate in Dubai allows for 2 level entries, as premium passengers were boarded through the lower entry door, which could be problematic for elderly passengers as they have to go up on a stairs to the business cabin. Male amenity kit bag has been shrunk which is good. The content remains the same. The service is good with crew members working hard. A minor tweak on the menu since the last time and improvement was noticed in this flight. Poach eggs served on the breakfast menu in this flight has improved since the last flight I took.

PER-SIN-AMS in business class first leg on 777-200ER refitted and second leg on 777-300ER. The two things that really set SQ apart are the catering and staff service. This is really excellent food nice drinks and perfect service. Changi airport also remains a nice hub but starts showing its age. However coming back to SQs one cannot deny that the seats and IFE are not on par anymore with big rival Emirates with whom I flew the outbound leg. I actually quite liked the older style seat on the SQ 777-200ER in a 2-2-2 layout which is perfectly fine and even better than Emirates' product on their 777s. But I still do not like the very wide seat in 1-2-1 as can be found on SQ's 77W and A380. The seat is not good for lounging to wide and short for sitting and in order to use the ottoman one must sit diagonally and lacks good support in the back. Also having to stand up in order to convert the seat into a bed (and back) is not practical. The bed is hard and too short for me (I am 192cm). The IFE cannot compete anymore versus what the ME carriers are offering. Smaller screen less choice and most unexplainable: no IFE on offer before take-off while with other carriers one can board early and already enjoy half a movie before boarding taxi and take-off are over. Anyway flying business with SQ is of course still a treat but others do much better today. Am curious to discover SQ's new business class product which is now being rolled out for its longer range routes.,Passive

I flew from Boston to CancÃºn, it wasn't the best plane ever, they don't even give you a drink of water but whatever, wasn't a big deal! The staff seemed to hate their job, rude and very bothered. My flight stopped in Myrtle beach and because it was the same flight that was gonna take me to the final destination we didn't have to get off the plane. The staff was all sitting down on their phones or talking when we stopped to Myrtle beach, of course they deserved a break. I wanted a water so I asked one of the staff members if I could buy it there or if I needed to go out to the airport and get it (first time flying with them). One of the staff rolled her eyes and asked you wanted it now, while scrolling on her phone. I said no I can wait until later. It took her 40 mins to bring it. That was ok, I said I'll wait. Anyways, coming back was hell. We came from Cancun to Florida to Boston. The plane landed late, and they made us wait 20 min in the plane because the airport was too full! I don't know who's fault that is but why schedule so many planes to land at once ? Going through immigration was hell, I only had 20 min to make it to my flight, I ran, I begged, I cut through and there was hope until they tell us that we still have to get our luggage and check it in again - okay I'm running like crazy with my heavy luggage and they won't check it in beside there was 5 min till the plane left. I don't know their rules but there's been times when flights get delayd for 10-20 min and it's no big deal. I talked to a lot of people on the line who were on the same boat as me, so why leave when 1/2 of your passengers are missing? Long story short I missed my flight. I go to customer service and I ask the lady when the next flight is, she says 12 hrs later. I'm like â€œwhat, 12 hours later?â€ I was obviously upset but not even once was I rude to anyone. I said no I'm not trying to fight I'm obviously upset because have to wait 12 hrs and miss work for a flight I missed because of you guys. I asked her if there was anything she could do? She went to check with her manager and said to me that they can't do anything because it wasn't their fault! They said the only thing they could do was give me a coupon for a hotel.

On board the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabin. I was seated near the back close to the toilet, which wasn't a problem. Beverage service was okay, everything was over priced, I bought a ginger ale for Â£2 and it was a cup, which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can. The only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing. The crew were friendly and helpful but I couldn't help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into Switzerland.

Service is functional/automated not very warm and cabin crew didn't appear happy to serve unlike SIA/Emirate/others. The IFE monitors were not sharp high resolution like onboard new Austrian business class. All in all would rate 6/10. Don't expect anything special it's not 4* service.

Mediocre service. Mediocre food. Even for the relatively low price this was not a great value - I recall that at the time I thought that taking my first flight on the Boeing 787 wasn't really a good experience.

No one could tell me what was going on. I asked about my luggage and was told about 6 times that it was (a) onboard and (b) no luggage from Toronto was onboard. A complete, unfriendly and hopeless mess partially redeemed only by getting to finally get onboard (after the aircraft waited for me for 20 minutes past its departure time) and enjoying a good Aeroflot Sukhoi plane and excellent service in Business class.

I have absolutely nothing to complain about on my first Spirit Airlines experience. I know the reputation of the airline however on my trip I was impressed with the experience for the price I paid. I flew DFW-CLE round-trip just a few days after the route started. I took only a personal size item and made sure I followed all the rules to avoid extra fees. The trip cost me $68 round trip total out the door. Flights were on time flight attendants were humorous and nice. I will say the experience was no worse than any other airline I have flown (I fly once every 1-2 months) and given the cost may have been better. This route will allow me to visit family at home in CLE more often. I felt I needed to give credit where it was due given the majority of the reviews for Spirit.,Promoter

Having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the BA website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft.

Why didn't BA notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight? Once we'd boarded we found that there was one extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg room.

I have flown with Air New Zealand for several years and have always found their service wonderful. That was not the case with my last flight to Hawaii. I felt like a number and some people received food and some did not. In my case my husband did and I didn't because of a new system of paying for food and even a drink of juice. For an international flight I think this is a terrible system which lead to a great deal of confusion and uncomfortableness for both the passengers and the flight crew.

By the time I arrived at the airport it was delayed. So I went online to check the flight status and it still said ""on time"". I went down to the Easyjet counter on the ground floor to report this (politely at first) and was met by a miserable woman who brushed me off. When I (still politely) persisted she simply ignored me. I then told her (not very politely) that I would report the matter to Easyjet to which she replied she did not work for Easyjet but for another company contracted by Easyjet to handle enquiries!

Just got off my first Spirit flight (Boston-Ft. Lauderdale-Tampa). Schedule matters most to me and tonight Spirit was my only option. I actually like Spirit's pay-for-carry-on program. By paying for a large carry-on you get to board the plane first. That relieves huge stress and clearly reduces the number of people dragging large suitcases onto the plane. The boarding time was pretty fast. The flight attendants were very courteous. The space between the seats is very tight. I'm 6/0â€ and my knees were jammed in. That said both of my flights were full. So obviously Spirit is meeting a market demand. I think all these negative reviews are from non-frequent fliers. But Spirit makes it possible for people to fly who may otherwise not be able to.,Passive
"  I am a regular traveller on many airlines and a One World Emerald FF. British Airways flight BA632 from LHR to Athens on 11th September was by far the worst cabin crew that I have encountered in 45 years of flying. The crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in Business Class, and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. After 1.5 hours in the air, we were offered a drink, the champagne was undrinkable, and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. After that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. That was all the service we received on the whole flight of 3.5 hours. No top up of drinks no offer of water, and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking. I even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft, and received no reply",Detractor
"  Excellent transcon on DL1290 from Atlanta to San Francisco in first class on a refurbished B757. Flight departed on time and arrived about 10 minutes late. Weather was forecast to be turbulent but pilot altered course and altitude to provide a smooth ride. First class flight attendant was first class. Friendly, energetic, and a pleasure to fly with. Service was fast, food was decent, and glasses were refilled. Noticed that wine is now served from a full bottle, which is a nice upgrade. The B757, while an oldie, had a completely new cabin with in-seat power, personal TV screen, and wifi. The wifi didn't work well on all four segments of my trip. Not sure if it is Delta's receivers, traffic load, or the fact that Gogo doesn't support their connection app anymore, but it took over 45 minutes to connect on each flight. (Gogo was great on Virgin America the week before). Fast gate arrival and my baggage was on the carousel at SFO before I made it to the arrivals level.

Few gripes on the inbound flight. The first been that they ran out of hot food and virtually everything else by the time they reached us in row 17 and the second been that despite there been a number of babies/kids on board they still insisted on putting the cabin lights on when a lot of people were asleep to do another trolley run. I understand there is a business need but a bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss. Legroom wasn't too bad given that I am 6'4"".

"  Xi'an to Pudong China Eastern on an A321. The priority/first class check-in area was difficult to find. For domestic flights it is located at the far-left check-in island (N) close to the security area. The N-sign is not visible from the departure hall. During the day I had a meeting near the airport, so I checked in about 8 hours before scheduled departure time for the flight to Pudong and for my connecting flight to Amsterdam. Check-in was OK, but staff barely spoke English. When I returned to the airport, the flight was delayed by 2 hours (because of travel disruption at Pudong Airport the aircraft arrived in Xi'an later than scheduled). As a result I would miss my connecting KLM flight from Pudong to Amsterdam. Airline ground staff were not very helpful, it took them 30 minutes before an English-speaking staff member arrived. They said they couldn't do anything for us, we should sort things out at Pudong Airport and made it KLMs problem (the flight was part of a KLM ticket). Because of all the hassle and because the staff where not very sharp we almost missed our flight. The MU A321 aircraft looked quite new, as do most MU A320s and A321. Good, soft seats, this time even with adjustable headrest. Good seat width and pitch for economy. Friendly flight crew. The food on this 2-hour flight was terrible. As it is on most domestic flights within China. We arrived with more than 2 hours delay and I missed the connecting flight to Amsterdam. Staff at Pudong were not helpful and it was quite chaotic at the transfer desk. They said I had to go to the KLM counter next day to check for flights to Amsterdam. Knowing that could be risky, as KLM flights are often fully booked, I called KLM to check for flight options. (KLM customer service was friendly and helpful and was able to put me on the first KLM flight of the next day). China Eastern arranged a hotel to spend the night. This hotel was old and shabby and quite far from the airport (30 minutes drive). Overall: good aircraft and flight crew, very poor food and customer service.",Detractor

"We arrived at the boarding gate to see the chaotic Ryanair queue in which we waited for a long time and then Ryanair announced that the first 90 cabin bags were guaranteed on board. When we finally got to boarding the aircraft a member of staff told us we were the 90th passengers, therefore our bags would be put in the hold for free with no lock on. Fair enough. However, after boarding the aircraft we found that many people behind us were entering with bigger cabin bags which hadnt been put in the hold and that there was indeed space in the bin above our seat. This started to annoy me particularly as passengers who got on with their bags (I don't know why) with the assistance of their cabin crew came from all over the aircraft to put their bags and coats in our overhead locker whereas we had to sacrifice our personal items to be put in the hold. Luckily for Ryanair, the flight was uneventful and our bags arrived safely. Overall, if after ninety pieces of cabin baggage have boarded the plane, enforce the 'putting cabin bags in the hold' rule fairly and accurately.",Passive

JFK to Orlando in First. Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight. Thus a 3-hour flight with just several rounds of a basket containing nuts biscuits and crisps - not a first class offering. Other than that the whole experience was much better (with arrival only slightly delayed) than I had feared given some of the reviews on here.,Passive
Birmingham - Zurich - Sao Paulo return. Last-minute on-the-day booking due to family circumstances. Flight from Birmingham to Zurich was late turning a tight connection into a stressful experience. Once on board the long haul run to Sao Paulo it was about as bearable as a 12-hour overnighter in economy can be. The return leg was similar - 12-hour overnighter from Zurich to Sao Paulo - I had pre-booked an aisle seat but was assigned at check-in to a middle seat - only when I threatened to call Swiss in Zurich did an aisle seat miraculously become available. However this turned out to be a rear seat with limited recline. As I am not a sleeper on night flights that was not a huge problem and it was good that the crew came around regularly with water. The food was standard fare - not good. 7-hour layover in Zurich was very welcome with the excellent Dayrooms facility at Zurich Airport. I was able to get 4 good hours of sleep before my onward flight and drive home. By the way I have rated the seat-comfort as very poor - this is not a reflection on Swiss - all economy seating is akin to purgatory on any long-haul.,Passive
"Not impressed with British Airways at all. We flew back from Denver after visiting family. We flew out with Lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the Middle/Far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. Our return Lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at Lufthansa. We were booked straight on to the BA flight back to London which left only an hour later. Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. Their Boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. Stick to an airline you know well, Lufthansa are the best European airline all round that I have used, and Emirates was the best internationally.

"  Rome to Split. My wife, and couple family members, and myself were on a very short flight from Rome to Split.

When we all arrived in Split the baggage handler said they plane is empty and no more bags. I thought he was joking since there was about 50 people still waiting for their bags. The airline never stepped up and contacted us in the time they said nor did they act as if this was an inconvenience for is who so not have our bags. We have been in split for 2 days without our bags and the airline has not completed the task we paid for. This is 2017 and how an airline could let any of their employees to let this happen to so many bags is very unprofessional.

"  The first leg of my itinerary to South America with Iberia took me on board their Oneworld partner, Finnair, from Helsinki to Madrid. Check-in at the Priority counter in Helsinki a breeze, despite all the crowds in the single AY departure hall at something that must be their busiest time of the day. Business Class also gave me the priority line through security which took place in just a minute or two. After the Security Control, you're forced directly to narrow lanes crossing a busy shopping centre full of passengers just trying to get through to their planes, blocking the walkways. Even if shopping in the Schengen area of Helsinki airport is no longer of interest to passengers travelling within EU, the whole airport is now packed with people panicking to reach their departure gates in time. They've even cut down the seating areas at all the gates, forcing passengers to hang around, wherever they can. Forget the days, when Helsinki airport was a pleasant experience! Same goes for the Finnair Business Class lounge. Previously, a quiet and pleasant oasis, but now totally packed, with people queuing for food or drinks, not to talk about seats. Not surprising as Finnair now even sells entrance to their Business lounge for its Economy passengers, too. Boarding the A321 went rather smoothly, although the so called Priority boarding was announced so shortly before the general one that most Business Class passengers ended up in the same queue in the jetbridge, as everyone else. The Business cabin on this flight consisted of just three rows and the only difference to Economy was that the middle seat was free and it contained a pillow and a blanket. After the usual pilot's welcome greetings in English, Finnish and Swedish, surprise: all cabin announcements were only made in English and Spanish, to the big surprise of all the Finns on board their national carrier. Later on during the flight it became clear that the entire cabin crew was Spanish, without any notions of Finnish. Soon after take-off the menus were handed out and apÃ©ritif was served. Despite all its cost cutting measures, I was pleased to see that Finnair continues to serve all the drinks in Business in design glass ware. Soon, dinner was served on a single tray, which for a four-hour long flight is rather disappointing. The food itself was decent, but nothing to write home about.

"After near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the UK, QR slipped up on the return.

Luckily I packed myself some goodies from Bangkok Gourmet supermarket. However I have to give top marks for ingenuity as I love the hot chocolate offered as an option to coffee or tea. Entertainment is the old school loop back movies on tiny screens simply not worth watching. Music collection is rather sad and limited a drastic contrast to those who are so accustomed to the Emirates ICE system. While Emirates would get 5 star on entertainment sadly I can only give 1 star for Qantas. Plane is old but immaculate no mood lighting no tooth paste in the toilet. Seat is cramp. Despite this I am glad sitting on the aisle seat and manage to sleep for a good few hours. The Qantas seat is definitely better than the one emirates deploy on their Airbus 330-200 which will give you a guaranteed back ache if ever attempted on a 9 hours flight. But top marks for the crews they save the short coming of the hard products.,Passive
"  Bangkok to London via Paris in Business Class, 4th April. Sad to say, it was the worst long haul business class flight I've had. Plus points: On time, relatively inexpensive - Â£1450. LHR-BKK-LHR, outward with KLM via AMS (which was much, much better). Minus point: Cabin service: Perfunctory, offhand, going through the motions (just about). This was a daytime flight but the shutters were battened down for more than 9 hours of a 12 hour flight. Patronisingly, like I was a 7 year old, I was told that ""passengers like to sleep monsieur"". So I checked the cabin and less than 20% were. - Lazy, inattentive cabin crew, they could do less work less if they kept the punters bedded down for as long as possible. Food: Dreadful. Just about OK for economy class, unacceptable for a business class. But at least the champagne was warm. A lamb dish that couldn't have been more overcooked. The rest was completely uninspiring. A self service ""buffet"" that any self-respecting airline should have been embarrassed to offer, even in economy. Narrow seat, but just about OK for sitting up in, but uncomfortable as a bed , angled rather than lie-flat. Verdict: The worst business class flight I've ever had. I'll never fly Air France by choice again. I would have had better value in Premium Economy with a proper airline. The quality of the cabin crew has a lot to do with whether you have a good flight or not. This lot would have been better working on a bus. The one exception was the female cabin attendant, who at least made eye contact and smiled with some sincerity. Air France: Remember, you have competition.",Detractor
BNE-MEL-BNE in mixture of economy out and business back. As is often noted in these columns if you get a good Qantas cabin crew they are the world's best. The FAs in business were superb and extremely professional. Lunch service and wines excellent. Only downside on this trip was that the business lounge in Brisbane (used for business class and platinum members) was closed so one had to endure a bunch of yobs and their beer and noise in the normal Qantas Lounge. Impossible to work in the normal Qantas Lounge that day so better to sit and work outside in the boarding area. Shame Qantas don't have a dress policy for their lounges at least just to exclude the dirty singlets and flip-flops mob. However I am again pleased to recommend Qantas to others.,Promoter
"Lufthansa was kind of special for me on my trip from Vienna to Milan via Munich. I have never had to catch a connection flight and even though I was a bit worried, I knew it would be okay and it was. The cabin staff were helpful and kind, and I can't complain about anything. This was the first time me flying with Lufthansa, but I hope, not the last one!",Promoter
"Los Angeles to Johannesburg via Dubai. Everything was as expected. The only downside on the entire trip was lack of Wi-Fi. Given that we were flying over the North Pole on the first leg, I can understand it, but it is still something Emirates should work on for the long haul flights. The leg from DXB to JNB was on a 777. Not as nice as the A380, but still great. They woke us up to feed us, which I thought was a nice touch, although I could see some people not liking it. I think the biggest problem with Emirates business class is that there's really no need to fly first class. The Business Class experience was better than the First Class trips I've had.",Promoter

 San Francisco to Seattle. I have had horrible experiences with United over the years. Today however was a much better experience. The flight attendants were kind and welcoming. We fly with our 4 kids about 3 times a year. Today is the first time in years they were invited to the flight deck to say hello to the captain. We still managed to take off in time even with a late boarding due to maintenance. If this is how they function as an airline then they have certainly turned the corner on their previous challenges.,Passive
"  Las Vegas to Newark. So they waited until 30 minutes before boarding to tell us about a 3 hour delay. After this delay, they let us board. After letting everyone get boarded and situated, they announce another hour delay. Instead of waiting another hour to board, they packed us in like sardines and continued to delay the plane. I understand delays are our of their control, but tell us as you find out. Dont trick us into being stuck on the flight. Nothing was added for a 5 hour delay, 2 of which were spent on the plane, sitting still at the gate. We paid for a flight that leaves at 11:15am. So, if you can't accommodate me, let me know. Don't drag me along. Get better at organizing flights before you have a whole company that screws over thousands of people. Never flying United again.",Detractor

"  Poor experience with Alitalia on Moscow-Rome-Naples-Palermo-Moscow route. Disorganised check-in in Moscow and Naples, where very few counters were open, led to very long waiting time. Moscow to Rome was delayed for 50 minutes for no apparent reason. Flight crew were quite nice, but the food was appalling - only a small muffin on a 3.5 hour flight is simply unacceptable. No spirits, wine or beer. The aircraft was very old, some seats had duct tape around the armrests. Seat pitch was uncomfortable, though after asking the crew I was reseated to another row. Due to the delay I have missed the connection to Naples and had to be rebooked to the next flight, which only came 4,5 hours later. I was given a food voucher for a sandwich, some fruit and a soft drink, but nothing else. Have filed a claim, still haven't heard back in a week. Rome-Naples - A319 with a truly appalling seat pitch - I have never experienced such uncomfortable seats. Most passengers could not sit in these at all, everyone was twisted sideways. No service whatsoever, not even water. Naples-Palermo - Embraer E-175 with surprisingly comfortable seats and decent cabin, service consisted of soft drinks only. Palermo-Moscow - A320 with, once again, uncomfortable seats. I was lucky to sit in an emergency exit row, though the pitch honestly was more or less the same as the pitch on premium airlines in standard economy seat. Service consisted of a small ham sandwich (flight duration is 4 hours), my requested special meal never came. Full drinks service, including wine. The crew on this flight were apathetic, with no intent to smile or create a pleasant experience, though all requests were quickly dealt with. Overall, Alitalia is not an airline I wish to fly with, considering its current state, but for the price (and the price for these flights - with luggage - was around 150 EUR in total) it was acceptable.",Detractor
" My flight from Los Angeles was delayed resulting tight connection to my flight from Beijing to Phnom Penh. When I reached Beijing airport, I approached the staff and explained to them of my situation. Without hesitation, the staff quickly called his officer and informed him of my situation.

" Air India Bengaluru to Mumbai. Upon arrival at the airport, we were notified that the servers for the airline were down since 3am and so due to this, there were flight delays and a huge cluster around the check in desks as the agents were trying their best to resolve the issues and get things moving as smoothly as possible. The airport manager was particularly impressive in ensuring that all the passengers were checked in for their respective flights and due to the systems being down, the agents had to manually write the flight details on the boarding passes to compensate for this unforseen situation. As a result of this, the flight which was supposed to depart at 6.45am instead left at 7.35am when pushback commenced. The aircraft cabin was very fresh and clean as the airline have leased the Airbus A320 neos so they are comparatively newer. The crew were lively, engaging and kept providing regular updates and even though the load on this flight was quite full, they still were attentive and polished. On this sector, a breakfast consisting of idlis, upma and croissants was served which was very tasty. Touchdown was 47 mins past the arrival time which was not exactly ideal but this has been mentioned extensively many times that the airline needs to improve in the OTP area. The in-flight was by and large, excellent. And if they can show their reliability with regards to OTP, they can beat any other airline on their day.",Passive
" Manila to Taipei. Service is really impressive. I did not expect too much because it was just a very short flight. I was surprised that it was rather full service. Plane used was A321. Despite being a full flight, the cabin was not too cramp. It is good they have toilets in the middle of the plane. There was a decent meal. Blankets were provided. Earphones were provided. I particularly enjoyed the aromatherapy inspired amenities in the toilet, which I would only expect for longer flights. I flew the same route with Philippine Airlines before and noticed a clear difference of service.",Promoter

"Helsinki lounge was well lit and beautiful, although the catering was rather poor. Because the JFK-flight leaves early in the afternoon several hours before the actual rush hour, the bar was closed and no warm food served. Aboard the plane the ambient was relaxed and nice, cabin crew were mostly very welcoming and warm, a pleasant surprise. Food was very good, they even offered a small scale crayfish party (typical Scandinavian autumn feast with whole crayfish and schnapps) as a starter. Entrees were nothing special, but well made. Seat was quite comfy, not superb but adequate. In JFK there really should be a priority border control line for business and first class passangers.

LHR/VIE/MLE and return September 2014. Outbound flights were fine and B767 although now extremely old are very well kitted out in Business class. Half full so excellent service. Return is where the problems start - at Male they can only check you in for the MLE-VIE sector - at VIE we found the flight overbooked for LHR with options for the next morning as they had let our seats go. Abysmal service when you have been flying for 9 hours and apparently this is not a concern of Austrian Airlines that there agents can't check you through from Male. We were not alone in having problems with OS connections on a Friday afternoon so be warned fly this route at your peril. After kicking off they eventually found our seats again but then due to technical problems delayed the flight by over an hour with what can only be described as limited explanation - the usual chaos at LHR (not OS's fault on this to be fair) added a further 40 minutes to the delay - a great holiday but not a nice surprise from Austrian at the end.,Passive

Then midway through the flight we heard ""the system is out of water. There will be no more water to drink and please try not to use the toilets unless necessary - who goes into an airline bathroom unless it is necessary?

Last week flew ORD-IAH-TYR/SHV-IAH-FLL-IAH-ORD in a mix of 737-900 (updated interior - great) EMB-135 and A319. All mainline jets were in Econ Plus or Emergency Row so leg-room was great. Most flights on-time and service was good. It's so hit and miss with UA as one flight had great service and the next mainline flight was bitter flight attendants. Regional flights were good - flight attendants had personality and very friendly service. Entertainment on some flights and others nothing but a shared screen with a movie released a year ago. Other than the IAH-ORD flight all on-time. Fare was decent so overall a good trip. With UA's new requirements for miles flown and price paid I won't get Gold Status next year and that will reduce my flying with them more than this year.,Passive
Flew from London to Hong Kong then onto Cebu flying with B777 and A340. Arrived at Heathrow a tad early and was checking in first class as there was nobody at business check in. The man behind the check-in was a delight. I proceed to the lounge and staff made a fuss of me. The check in staff member came over and said he would escort me to the plane and allow me to board my seat first. Flight delayed 40 minutes but the cabin crew had served champagne and after take off dinner was served. I only watched one film as I was managed to sleep for 7 hours. Breakfast was great. Connecting flight to Cebu on an A340 and it was interesting to be seated in the old style funeral type business seat I can see why most hated it but I am not bothered as it was only a 2.5 hour flight. On arrival a Cathay Pacific staff member was waiting for me and quickly escorted me to immigration - from the moment I got off the plane through to immigration luggage and customs it took 6 minutes. My return trip this year after spending Christmas and New Year was on a much newer business class seats and such an improvement. Tried out the new Bridge lounge the staff are a delight again. Boarded first to my seats and the staff recognised me and made sure I was comfortable.,Promoter
Aegean is really unpredictable. Can be excellent in every way or disappointing in many other ways. For example though their fares are in no way low cost they started charging 20 euros for a piece of luggage each way (short haul) and 30 euros for longer flights i.e. to Spain. BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine. Yes on this flight they used the good jet steps and not their favourite bus transport to - from aircraft. One thing that is really impressive is the inflight attendants exceptionally professional.,Passive
We flew 4 legs with Asiana Sydney-London in March return Paris-Sydney in April. Only on the ICN-LHR leg did we experience the new Smartium seats. They are good. However that experience was spoiled by the cabin temperature being so hot that we didn't sleep well. FA's seemed as though they were mechanical rather than really providing business class service. On the other legs FAs were more personal and attentive. The seats were the old style pods that do not lie flat. Food and drink were good and extremely well presented and plentiful. The downside of all legs was the extremely poor IFE. It was not on demand even in the Smartium cabin and the choice was very small. We had an overnight connection. The hotel provided by Asiana was not the Hyatt Regency but was the Best Western Premier Incheon Airport.,Passive
Fly from Birmingham to Seoul via Paris. Had very pleasant trips apart from the hiccup at the check-in desk at Seoul but overall inflight service was very good!

"For a one hour flight, Ryanair were not the greatest. It's nothing to shout home about. However, because we forgot to check in online, we were stung with a Â£100 charge at Luton airport, and this took a big chunk of our holiday money. The flight was smooth, and we were glad we booked priority seats, because flying with Ryanair before, we were well aware of how uncomfortable the seats can be. However, they are not exactly the most comfortable of seats at the front row too. The staff were very nice. The price of the food was too expensive. It cost us Â£5.50 for a ham and cheese panini, which was priced as â‚¬5 in the brochure. Our flight was Â£200, and all of those charges on top of that was not worth the time or day for a one hour flight.

Apparently no need to fix things at THY. Open wires at my seat seat adjustment at several seats did not function normally. Overall low seat comfort. Crew inattentive and impolite - when I pointed out that a toilet indicator light was also not functioning I was told that the light for another toilet was working.

Check-in was uneventful in FRA used the Sakura lounge (JAL). The business class product on this new A330-200 was superb. The business class section is divided in 2 sections: 18 and 12 pax in a 2x2x2 configuration giving a very cosy and warm atmosphere plenty of space. This aircraft is equipped with proper full flat bed. The bed is a good 2 meter long about 50 cm wide (maybe more) the seat fairly wide (although narrower than SQ) which should not be a problem. We had all the amenities you can expect and a very soft comforter and pillow. The food was pretty good. we were offered a pre-dinner drink and a selection of Chinese style or western style food was available. The crew was available during the whole flight at the snap of a finger. The only negative points is that we were rushed through the meal. We had to slow down to make them understand there was no rush! Although the crew was nice trying their best to be polite and use proper English to get understood some lacked the elegance to provide a high standard service. The entertainment system was pretty good a large screen great picture and good selection of movies. Overall it was a very relaxing flight very good value for money in Business Class.,Promoter
" Jacksonville to Boston via Charlotte. If American Airlines didn't have such good credit card offers for mileage accrual, I would reconsider flying with them. I am a regular user of American because of convenience of routes and schedules, but I find myself turned off by their oddly convoluted (and long) boarding times, less than helpful ground staff, and overwhelmingly apparent cost-cutting. I purchased a premium seat online for one segment of my trip, and was charged accordingly. However, upon check-in, I was told the payment was not received and that I'd have to repay the $41.60 fee, and no effort was made to rectify the problem on the check-in staff's part. Dispute is still ongoing with my bank. Let's move onto the actual product though. The two aircraft I flew were definitely showing their age, but the new leather seating and adjustable headrests (737-800 models) were greatly appreciated and of good quality. Arrival and departure times were more than punctual and flight attendants were friendly enough, but the borderline harassment that ensues when 6 minutes of intercom time is devoted to credit card advertisement is definitely a turn-off. I didn't use the wifi, but I did use the stream-to-device entertainment, which worked well. There was also traditional overhead monitors available on the 737-800, playing standard sitcom fare. Overall it's an average experience, but a few factors such as aging planes and odd advertisements, along with cheap biscotti snacks and pricey buy-on-board options leave just the slightest bad taste in my mouth.",Passive

"  London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points. The payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my future travel options.

After 45 minutes, we boarded again. I discovered my seat would not recline on the 7 hour overnight flight and I could not be moved to another seat. Then we were told none of our checked baggage was loaded and would be delivered to our final destination the next day. Their solution? Free wi-fi for everyone! My touchscreen was faulty and I could do nothing, so I had a bright light shining in my face the whole time. I asked for it to be shut off several times, but they couldn't. Needless to say, I had no luggage during my one day stay. I was given an overnight bag that included some grooming essentials, but I had no clothes, so that was of no help other than being able to brush my teeth. I sent a complaint to their customer relations department asking for a refund as soon as I returned to the States on July 30. It's now September 16 and it hasn't even been reviewed! Do they have that many complaints that it 2 months to read an email?! I've called 5 times to get status and get pushed out a few more days or a few more weeks every time. The last call was this morning and I tried to escalate to speak to a supervisor multiple times, but that was clearly not going to happen. She told me ""two more weeks."" Two days ago I was told 4 weeks and last week I was told a few more days. Who is right?! I asked for a guarantee and she said that's just how it works. Whatever that means. I am appalled at this airline and would never fly with them again. I refuse to take a travel credit if offered and just want my money back. This has been a complete nightmare!",Detractor

"Was really not sure what to expect on my first ever Air India flight flying from London Heathrow to Delhi, but very pleasantly surprised. The Dreamliner is a really good passenger experience, seats on Air India were wide and comfy, with large seat back tv, and superb views through the extra large windows. IFE was good, although lacked depth, especially on the audio side, where there was little for the western taste. Food was very good, I tried a Western and Indian vegetarian breakfast, both good in size and quality. Cabin crew were attentive and were happy to give me two cans of beer during drinks service. Departed on time and arrived on time, seat bet sign came on a few times but no turbulence materialized, so they were being cautious on this front, that's a good thing. Arrived on time into Delhi, airport was pretty empty, and e-visa / immigration took 5 minutes to pass through, bags through quickly and then into the humid and hot night air of Delhi. Enjoyed the experience, and the Dreamliner would not bother messing around travelling via the Middle East when you can have such good service on a non-stop flight.",Passive
I've had to fly Alaska almost every Monday morning and Thursday evening for the past 2.5 months from Seattle to Oakland because of a project I was on. Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours,Promoter
" San Francisco to Reno. This is the worst airline I have ever been on. I have given this airline 5 chances and every time something goes wrong.

I did not pay to be lied too - I can get that for free.

I advised the staff that the contents of my purse is in the bag, their response was $100.00 before you can board. I took out all ID, cash, cards, and jewelry. I then let Spirit Airline keep the bag.

We travelled to Noumea after Xmas with AirCalin code share on a Qantas flight - I thought we were lucky to be on a Qantas flight initially. The check in process was great the boarding Ok but the inflight meal was foul. The hot breakfast option was poached eggs-these arrived hard as anything covered in disgusting beans with hard boiled potato-totally inedible. The bread roll was hard and the tea was stewed! Thankfully one hostess offered me a fresh cup which was better but still not enjoyable. I was very surprised as I expected better service from Qantas than AirCalin. We travelled back with AirCalin and the service was so much better the meal was enjoyable the drinks bread etc was freely offered even brandy at the end of the meal.

The seats had a dated and tired look about them - cushion of my seaton the inbound flight had collapsed into the seat-frame so that it was as if I was sitting in a bucket.

Just returned to Australia after flights booked through Finnair. Overall not really impressed with the service. A change in our itinerary was our first upset-we never really got an explanation as to why. On our outward flight we sat on the plane for an hour whilst baggage was being loaded. The aircon wasn't functioning so we sat sweating for an hour. Cabin service was quite poor just above a budget airline standard. We asked if we might have a drink and were brushed off and remained thirsty. During long legs the flight attendants were rarely seen outside of meal service.

" Jakarta to Amsterdam in September. Before take-off, a passenger had his seat reclined and fully extended forward. Only at the very last few minutes before take-off did the flight attendant ask this passenger to adjust his seat back to upright position. He only slightly adjusted the seat. Seat space and adjustment were not as comfy as in Cathay or SQ. The seat could only extend a certain distance forward or back before the seat back had to move to adjust. The food was sub-standard. My fave champagne Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose that used to be served was downgraded to a fairly ordinary brand. The entertainment was pathetic for me. I pressed the call button and no one came. So I turned off the notification light. I pressed the call button again. Still no one came and I finally had to flag down a flight attendant who walked past.",Detractor
" Terrible experience on American. Was flying from Peoria to Houston via DFW on Sept 21. Flight was late/rebooked out of Peoria due to bad weather at DFW, then couldn't land at DFW so had to refuel in Wichita and sit there a couple hours, then finally got to DFW at about 12:30a & it was about 1a by the time I had gotten to talk to a gate agent about flights home. Many customers had to sleep in the airport. All hotels were reportedly booked & American made no effort to help us find lodging. I tried several hotels and finally got to one at 2:15am. Left out of DFW the next morning, got to Houston, but my luggage was sent to the wrong airport (IAH instead of Hobby). My destination had been changed the previous day (Houston Hobby, then IAH, then Hobby again due to flight delays, cancellations, etc), but they assured me repeatedly that the bags would be delivered to the correct airport. The AA app showed I had checked 4 bags when I had only checked two. I called AA and straightened it all out but when my luggage wasn't delivered to my home I had to call again and they said they had no record of the prior call and that they might not be able to get luggage delivered to me until next day. I finally gave up and drove 20 miles to IAH myself to get the bags. Worst treatment I've ever experienced on an airline.

London Heathrow to Montreal 28 August 2014 Boeing 777-333ER C-FNNW. One of Air Canada's latest Triple Sevens equipped with their latest interior in economy with black leather seats and a very cramped 3-4-3 configuration. Very narrow seats uncomfortable but just OK for a 6.5 hour flight. The controller for the in-flight entertainment screen is now placed in the arm rest just where you lean your elbows causing lights and cabin call alerts all over the cabin. Little thought has been placed into the design of Air Canada's new economy cabin! Also my light control was turning on the incorrect light (obviously little testing of their systems on a new aircraft). Cabin attendants all old-timers and all very miserable but this is consistent with my experience of AC's transatlantic offering. Food - perhaps it is time they quit the hot food service! Still cannot believe this economy cabin design has actually entered service and other airlines that also employ the 3-4-3 configuration on the Triple are far more comfortable.,Passive
"Flew Sydney to Wellington return. As a regular Trans-Tasman traveller, Qantas has never ceased to disappoint. I chose the seats beforehand (front aisle, using One World Sapphire status) and took advantage of Q-Eats, which allowed me to choose meals before the flight. I opted for a Beef salsa in smoky-BBQ sauce and assorted vegetables. Check-in was available online. Inexplicably (and somewhat irritatingly) this is only available on a desktop and not on the app or on any mobile devices. If you try to check-in on a mobile devise, it will instruct you to check-in at the airport (which closes 90 minutes before the flight!). Because I didn't have to line up, owing to British Airways Silver (equivalent to Qantas Gold), I can't comment on the efficiency of service - there is rarely anybody in those lines. But there wasn't a lot of people queueing in the Economy lines. The service on the way there and back was impeccable, food was generous and tasty.

Every airline has delays but I have had more flight delays due to mechanical issues on United than any other airline by a large margin, both in total number and percentage. I bring an extra change of cloth when flying United because i can never trust it will get me to my destination on the same day. Only reason I still occasionally fly United is due to limited selection of airline to several smaller airports I have to fly into for work. I would never fly United for any personal trips nor would I recommend this airline to anyone else. To me, if i can't get there by another way, it is not worth going.

"  Two days before my flight from Amsterdam Schiphol to Helsinki, I upgraded from economy to business using my Finnair points (10.000 points one-way). Upgrades if available can be requested very easily through the Finnair website. At Schiphol BC passengers of AY can use priority security in T1 and relax at the conventient Aspire Lounge. Boarding via priority lane was well organized. Overall the 2 hour and 20 minutes flights was convenient. Business class seats where similar to the economy seats, but with the middle seat left unoccupied for personal space. This way of laying out business is not uncommon on European flights by EU carriers. Not sure if the pitch was larger than in economy but for a 2+ hours flight it was OK. There was no pre-take-off drink, but soon after take-off the flight attendant started service. There where two meal options offered (chicken or 'meat'), which I did not expect after reading reviews of AY business class mentioning having only one type of meal. The starter was very tasty and main course was average since the minced meat was a little chewy. I wasn't really sure what I was eating since there was no menu. The champagne Finnair serves is of OK quality. The flight attendant was very friendly and busy serving the 8 BC passengers during the entire flight. Finnair apparently installed new seats in their A321 aircraft, or it was a new aircraft, not sure, anyhow these seats feature an iPad holder on the back of the seat in front which is very convenient! Although the clip at the top of the seat that holds the iPad does not reach my iPad mini, I was able to stabilise it by putting the screen cover in the inflight magazine holder. All together it was a very pleasant flight. In the near future, when I have sufficient AY points, I would opt for BC again on their EU flights.",Promoter

Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30.

" Spirit Airlines prices are incredible. I'm usually able to put my bag under the seat at no charge. When I do need a larger bag, I check it since that's the cheapest. Here's the negative I've read : Pay for baggage - yes but you have to pay for bags on every airline except southwest. 2. Pay for drinks - yes but drinks cost the same if you buy it in the terminal. Pay $10 to print boarding pass at gate - I've never had to have my boarding pass printed at the gate or at check in. Leg room I don't find much different from other airlines.

We made a stop in Wuhan where we exited the aircraft, went through customs/immigration and then boarded the aircraft again to go to Guangzhou to go to Ho Chi Minh City. I was traveling with three small children and needed my stroller. Instead of receiving the stroller at the gate, it had to be picked up at baggage claim. On the flight back, we went through customs/immigration twice. Once in Guangzhou and again at Wuhan. Even though we weren't leaving the airport, we had to apply for a temporary visa. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The negative review is for the deceiving number of stops and the inconvenience of not receiving strollers at the gate. I would not recommend this airline.",Detractor

" London to Colombo via Kuwait. I had an awful experience flying with KU. Both flights to Colombo via Kuwait City and back to London were delayed, which meant missing my onward connections in Colombo and Kuwait (from Delhi). Got no sympathy nor assistance from KU staff at the very poor Kuwait airport. I ended up re-booking my flight at my own expense in Colombo and being rerouted through Cairo to get to London, which added 7 hours to my journey. I received no apology nor compensation from any KU staff. Their customer service was so poor ,with an attitude of passing the buck, just to get rid of you. Twice,I was promised to be met and assisted at the gate, nothing materialized. This airline must be avoided at any cost, Their staff are poorly trained in dealing with delayed flights and service recovery. As a delayed passenger, you are helpless and can't access Kuwait Airways customer service managers because they don't answer their phones. Anything less than a star in your rating?",Detractor
"CGN-IST-GZT-IST-FRA with Turkish Airlines in August. CGN-IST with A320. Boarding smooth, seats cramped and uncomfortable. No IFE and overhead monitors not working. Cabin crew were friendly and food very tasty. IST-GZT with B737 delayed 40 min. The seats were better but no IFE, snack was served. GZT-IST with A320, delayed 40 min. IST-FRA with A321 was the best flight. Seat 8F at emergency exit door with big legspace. Very good IFE with working personal monitors.

Flew DEL-BKK-SGN and return. Each of the legs had some shortcomings which was a big letdown compared to previous experiences with TG. The DEL-BKK leg was on an ageing A340-600 with particularly uncomfortable seats and obsolete IFE. The screens were low definition and barely visible if the blinds were up (it was a daytime flight). On the plus side food (other than the dessert) and the service was fine. The BKK-SGN leg was by stark contrast on a new B787. Owing to the short duration no headphones provided so the fantastic IFE is largely inaccessible. Cold box meal was adequate for an hour long flight. In comparison the aircraft for the SGN-BKK flight was a tired A330 with hard seats and no IFE. The B777-200 used on the BKK-DEL leg was far more comfortable and modern but it had the worst food on any of the legs including the cold meals on the Saigon flights. Service was functional but seemed rushed and was brusque on a couple of occasions. It was a full flight but I haven't had the crew on other full DEL-BKK flights be as snappy as this set was. That set and the ground staff at Bangkok airport diminished a lot of the goodwill from the good service on the other flights. Overall IFE needs to be improved to keep up with other premium competitors but still stands head and shoulders above Indian competitors on the same routes.,Passive
" Toronto to LHR and LGW to Toronto return in WT+. Finally, BA has moved back into it's own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok â€“ but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense â€“ a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe's â€œflower duetâ€ burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it's even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security â€“ even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell Â£5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow â€“ more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream â€“ off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don't (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful â€“ both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn't take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it's mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may this improvement last!",Promoter

Flight LX 454 Zurich to London City Airport on 16 June 2014. We boarded the plane as normal welcomed onboard and told we were ready to take off despite an earlier bird strike in one of the engines. Informed there was a 20-minute delay due to changing weather conditions. 15 minutes into the flight the pilot announced that we were returning to Zurich as the earlier bird strike had apparently damaged the engine too much. Then we had to be patient for an extra half hour due to the heavy incoming traffic to Zurich. In the end it took us what felt like the same amount of time as the flight would have taken to London. To offer an alternative a crew member announced that we should take the next scheduled flight to London Heathrow at 21.20 hrs. There was no alternative to London City allegedly due to lack of smaller aircraft that could land there. The hostess also announced that as soon as we land we should go straight to gate 31D to board the new flight stressing the point about going straight to that gate twice. I decided to go to Heathrow so I rushed along many other passengers to gate 31D and queued up only to find the gate unattended. 20 minutes later a staff member appeared and told us we should go gate 53D get our new boarding passes there and come back to gate 31D for boarding. While providing us with our new boarding passes the staff at gate 53D also gave us a food and refreshment voucher by way of compensation they said. These were valid for the coffee bar across the hall. So we all went to the coffee bar and queued up there to get our â€œ freeâ€food and drink. Alas we found out that the vouchers was valid for a bar of chocolate and bottle of water. The time was after 8 pm. I was the last passenger to get a new boarding pass I got seat 36B which is a middle seat in the last row. The best seat in town. Finally took off at 21.55 hrs. We touched down in London Heathrow about 22.30 local time. It was about half past midnight by the time I got to my destination.,Detractor

LHR-FCO-CTA return in June. Overall it was a good experience but in the months between buying the tickets and the actual flights they changed our itinerary 3 times. This was due to departure time changes and eventually cancellation of the domestic leg. These changes were communicated to us in email and in Italian language without offering alternatives refund or assistance. Bag drop at LHR a bit chaotic as Alitalia operates several flights in the morning and it seemed not enough desks were open. We ended up waiting 40 minutes in the queue before getting fast tracked along with other passengers on the FCO flight. At FCO they seem to operate a coach service for every single flight. One flight out of 4 was significantly delayed (FCO to LHR). I liked the generous legroom on board. No sandwiches given out like BA does on European flights only a small pack of crisps and a drink. Flight attendants were professional and helpful. Despite the above issues I would fly with Alitalia again as they were helpful and professional when needed.,Passive

And they don't have much snack options like banana or chips available like in other flights. So I ended up being hungry all the time and literally waiting for food. Economy class service is just Ok. The crew is not bad but like someone said they are very robotic and no warmth at all. And one or two can be rude too. IFE is bad, very limited and boring options. Also despite chunk of passengers being from India, they don't offer any Indian entertainment. Still its a value for money courier.

Food good, cheese and crackers was great. Entertainment options were very limited. Movie choices, television shows and music album choices were all disappointing. Seat was comfortable but a little narrow. Not much in the way of storage space. My phone went flat over the 13 hour flight when plugged into the USB port. I'd give Delta a 7/10 on this flight.

" Los Angeles to Atlanta. Two last minute tickets from LAX to Atlanta cost me $59 ea one way & I had plenty of options to choose from, so I chose the earliest flight in case it got delayed. The lowest fare from other airlines was $500 before taxes for the worst flight that had multi-stops and a 4 hr layover, the best flight cost almost $900 for two people. I hope these reviews do not mess up the cheap flights that you can get with this airline. My trip was great & we had a 4 hr delay, but I planned ahead. I booked my flight for an early departure so even if we were delayed we would still get to our destination at a reasonable time. We made flexible accommodations for arrival at our hotel ( check in until 7am). Paid for checked baggage when booking( so cost us about $60 total for two bags), packed our things smart to get the most out of the 40lb limit, still had almost 15lb extra in ea bag & we took all of our clothes (buy lightweight luggage- pack heavy stuff in smallest luggage, lighter stuff in bigger luggage), utilized the two free personal bags to the max (packed all of child's heavy pants/ jeans in my 18"" personal bag (no weight limit just has to fit in personal bag space on aircraft there is a bin for you to test this out at check in). We checked in 24 hrs ahead via spirit app, so it took 2 min at the kiosk to print our boarding passes and luggage tags. We arrived 3 hrs early, an extra hour early than recommended for domestic flights in case we ran into issues. Customer service was good because we had no complaints, we knew that to get these prices, the airline did not keep extra planes & pilots available to cover delayed flights like more expensive airlines do, and that everything was al la carte. We took care of our own needs by considering the tips spirit/airport suggested: bringing our own snacks and entertainment and being well prepared. We didn't buy the $11 insurance, but considering the Logistics behind this airline, it may be smart to do so. I did witness two cancelled flights and they were offered refunds or to wait for the next available flight. Insurance apparently reimburses for hotel stays, having to purchase new tickets, and for lost baggage ( if you want to ensure you get your baggage, arrive early to get your bags on the plane, that's just flying 101). Our seats were also very roomy and comfortable, and I am a plus size woman. I saw tall men and bigger sized people also seated comfortably. Our seats were together because they were purchased in one transaction, don't want to pay to choose seats then purchase your tickets in one transaction, there is an option to see how many seats are available b4 buying, so if there are only a few left, you probably shouldn't buy them if you're wanting to sit together.

The flight was only Â£65 one way so no complaints.",Promoter
" Chicago to Tampa. Weather can be a significant challenge when flying. We arrived early for our 5.50 pm flight out of O'Hare to Tampa, and saw a 2.25 pm flight traveling the same route. We checked with a desk agent as to whether getting on that flight might be an option, and she kindly did a quick check to see if there were any seats. She told us we might have a good chance to get on but we needed to hurry to the gate where the flight was scheduled to load. It was quite a hike but we made it to the 2.25 pm flight gate. The first staff member we met seemed confused about our request, but we had received an email from United indicating that fees were not being charged to change flights due to weather so he eventually put us on Stand-By. While he was working on the Stand-By tickets, we struck up a conversation with the supervisor of the desk - and that's what impressed us. She was very cordial and gracious. She kindly asked us to give her a few minutes to see what she could work out and in a couple of minutes she called us up and had two tickets, and noted she was able to find two seats together for us on the flight. Her level of professionalism was unusual. The change of flights went well. The flight was fine.",Promoter
"First and last time flying Spirit 1/2/15 - 1/5/15. 1) The bag dimensions I was given on the phone were smaller than the actual bin they have at the airport to double check. The luggage I was using was 2 inches larger so I stuffed everything into a small duffle bag. 2) Flight was delayed 4x due to ""crew problem"". I arrived in Tampa 4 hours later than scheduled and it took 2 more hours to get to our hotel because I had to keep calling and rescheduling the shuttle. We lost 1 full day of our short 3.5 day vacation because of Spirit. They offered no credit at all. 3) Flight going back to Chicago delayed an hour for no reason. They kept switching gates between A16 and A17 and people were so confused we all stood there looking at each other. Someone going to Dallas boarded the Chicago flight in the confusion and they had to run after him. Once we were on the plane we had no pilots! When they finally showed up they explained over the intercom that they had just flown the plane in the next gate in from Detroit and they thought they were flying it back to Detroit. I think we left 30 minutes after our delay time. At this point I am glad I arrived in one piece. If they had offered some small piece of something to show they cared maybe I would consider flying them again but absolutely not. If they gave me a free round trip I wouldn't accept.",Detractor

SYD-PEK-SYD in Business Class. Travelling for work all I really want is the cheapest business class seat that I can find for overnight flights to China there are few options reasonably priced. Air China's offering on A330 equipment is an older style seat but is virtually flat and with plenty of space. It was set quite low to the ground so was easy to hop over the person adjacent when going to the toilet. Food below average for business class and AVOD was limited with mostly older films. Didn't really matter too much when I slept most of the 11.5hrs each way. Flight crew were efficient and polite but characterless. Australian captain noticed on the return flight which was reassuring.,Passive
The staff at the check in at Santiago were the worst I have ever experienced at any airline. We had advised our connection would be close and arrived 80 minutes before the plane left and they had sold our seats!

We are flying with an infant. While I appreciate the airline is giving priority to passenger with infant or special needs there are still quite a few things lacking to the overall service. Instead of a long write up, below is a list of things we have encountered so far. Assistant at the check-in counter is impatient. Speak so low and unclear. She let off when she found out our stroller is one piece instead of two because she printed two baggage claim tickets for the stroller. Promised baby food before take-off never arrives. Flight attendant is not apologetic when closing the overhead baggage compartment loudly on top of our sleeping baby. Overhead compartment has two large green/flat bags belong to the airline. We are lucky to fit all our small bags there. Typical hand carry baggage definitely won't fit. A passenger sitting not far from us dropped his food tray and made a mess. The same flight attendant (a guy) walked by twice without even offering help. That is terrible. In general, all attendants seem to be very busy doing their ""thing"".

There are few ""couple seats"" but unfortunately all were booked a month before departure. The seats were quite cramped. No power outlet to charge you mobile phones. The food that was served was the worst airline meal ever had. Totally bland and overcooked chicken. Cheap ice creams.

The crew were very attentive and active throughout most of the flight, going through the cabin to collect trash and see if the passengers needed anything. The one downside is the amount of entertainment compared to Emirates but the movies they did have were superb and the IFE was very responsive.

Delta did not notify me of flight cancellation of a direct flight from PHX to JFK airport that was to leave at 8.30 which had been changed previously from 9.30 until we had arrived at the terminal. Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off.

Flew on the LHR-BKK sector (TG911) with B747 after not having done it in a long long time. I was frankly a bit worried at first having read some of the negative reviews but to my surprise - worth every penny! I personally found the staff to be the best factor on that trip so attentive friendly and welcoming. For me that made up for the uncomfortable seat and the slightly bland meal(s). I will give TG credit on making an effort to sort me out a veggie meal at the last minute (I hadn't pre-ordered it) - yet TG went the extra mile to satisfy me as the passenger. Inflight entertainment was brilliant too! So many choices! I'd definitely fly them again and recommend that you fly Thai!,Promoter

The flight back even arrived 45 minutes early in both Calgary and Vancouver. The airplane going to Cuba had definitely seen cleaner days but the one coming back was fine. The meals they served were quite good. Inflight movies were OK. I travel a lot on business and I have to say that tight seats and so on are the norm and maybe some of the complaints about these kind of things are from people who's expectations are higher than their budgets. If you are more than 5'6"" pay for the extra leg room! If you want to sit together - pay for the seat selection! With a smaller charter airline they don't have as many options when something slips as one of the bigger carriers - make sure your schedule has some wiggle room in case of problems.",Promoter

SEA-AMS on DE via FRA. Uncertain of exactly how long my business trip would take I booked one way segments. Overall I would give the experience 3.5 out of 5 stars mostly because of the fact the airline uses Boeing 757/200 and 300 series aircraft while I prefer the more spacious less confining comfort of twin aisle or wide body jets. Service wise Saga class is worth the upgrade if for nothing more than the extra legroom. The seats are old generation recliner seats like those found on US domestic first class years ago. They are fine for day flights but I wouldn't want to attempt a comfortable nights rest in one. Meal service on board is limited to 2 choices of entrees and the flight attendant told me one of them is usually a fish dish of some kind. I only had just short of an hour for my connecting flight from KEF to SEA so I didn't have time to stop off in the lounge. It's interesting to note that all of Icelandair's flights arrive and depart KEF around the same time so it can get very busy at the customer service counters. It wasn't a bad experience overall but this wouldn't be my first choice for transpacific flights. In fact the price was the most appealing factor in choosing to use Icelandair.,Passive

Leaving on QF 1 on 12 Oct and from Dubai back to Sydney via London on Emirates planes. All sectors on A380. The aircraft is the common factor between Qantas and Emirates. But the experience is so different. The Qantas flight attendants are very professional in the way they go about their work. Emirates FA's are to a man and woman under 30 lack experience and customer skills. On EK 2 from LHR to Dubai on Saturday 18 October it was particularly bad. A couple of FA's would not have been out of place on easyJet. One fixed up her lipstick during a meal service whilst serving. On four sectors flown in the last week on Qantas and Emirates planes it can be said that Qantas came out way on top. This is not some pro Australian rant. Have been using Qantas and Emirates combination for a while now and the same result. What can Emirates do? Get some serious training for their cabin crews and some old heads on board to oversee the younger staff. At the moment they all look and act like kids serving in McDonald's. I will continue to fly Emirates as their scheduling from Australia is so good and much of my work is in the Gulf and Europe.,Passive

Keep in mind that I wait 30 mins+ before I get to the rep. Finally when I went on the website to file the claim about damage luggage, I got nothing.

We were told drinks would be served after dinner after we buzzed flight attendants asking for a wine.

"  Frankfurt to Miami. I checked in at the Nice, France airport with Lufthansa and received my three boarding passes. I didn't have to go through security at Frankfurt and after visiting the Lufthansa Star Alliance Lounge I walked to the boarding area. When I showed my boarding pass I was told that I needed to go to Document Check. I then got back in line and there was another problem so I went to the counter. I was told to go back to the end of the line and try again. I'm Group 1 so I wasn't happy about that. The third try I still could not get in through the gate. I was told that because I had an exit row seat I had to go through a different entrance. Good Grief. United is the only airline that I know of that seats 10 across in Premium Economy on a 777-300. The seats are tight with a 17 inch width. About 35 minutes after take-off, they turned the fasten seatbelt sign off. First came a bag of bread sticks, then came a small bottle of water, then came my food with plastic tableware and then the beverage cart with a complementary glass of wine or a beer. There was no hot or moist towel. After all food items were picked up, they came by with another glass of wine or beverage. The fasten seatbelt sign came on several times during the flight because of a very light chop. United has changed the recorded announcement to ""Please fasten your seatbelt."" The German speaking flight attendant had a very loud voice which would have made sleeping difficult, but in the economy cabin, they never turned off the lights or asked people to close their window shades so it was impossible for me to sleep. Prepare for landing, which means the fasten seatbelt sign is on and seats need to be upright was 50 minutes before landing, which makes for a long 50 minutes.

I was seat 83A (top deck, double seat) and the leg room was no better than you would find on a Ryanair flight to Dublin.

We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires.

After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss. Special small touches such as the amenity kit, comfy pillow and blanket made this flight comfortable.",Passive
BOS-JFK. The flight was delayed without any explanation. No greeting while boarding with a bored flight attendant at the door. The plane was clean.

But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller.",Detractor
Flew from BOS to DFW via CVG January 23rd. Very good experience small aircraft both legs but clean I was in Economy Comfort. Flight attendants very good with excellent customer service. From CVG to DFW the flight was delayed due maintenance but it was repaired and the flight went without any issues. Arriving in Dallas just some minutes late but the baggage service was very good and the bags were out quickly. My return flight was DFW to BOS via ATL January 29th also very good planes were full both legs. I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all. I think if you are paying something extra for a seat you should go on group 1 despite that the flight was very good and the flight attendants were ok. The leg from ATL- BOS was very nice I got Economy Comfort flight attendants very professional and cool both flights departed and arrived on time.,Promoter
MAD-MAN-MAN. Hour plus delay on both sectors no explanation from ground staff or flight crew and a long long wait for bags to come through at Barajas T4 on the return.

I have been travelling with this airline mainly for business purpose and many times in business class. Am I expecting too much when I compare with their magazines and the image they try to carry? All in all I have never been happily surprised by nice new features that modern airlines may offer. Rather it is always more or less the same and in term of seat comfort in business class it clearly lags behind most of its serious competitor. Food is generally good but it can also be sometimes frankly disgusting (when you fly to Paris from a foreign country). Service is fine but seemingly very disorganised between boarding and take-off (flight attendants running in all directions back and forth with no apparent co-ordination - when are going to actually optimize their movements inside the very narrow pathways?). A nice old lady with old worn furniture and faded recipe the actual image of this airline.,Detractor

The airport checkin was 50Euro fee for just printing a piece of paper and nobody was in the checkin line to hold the line. Then they hit you with the baggage fee of 60 Euros. I ended up paying almost 200 Euros in checkin and baggage fees for 2 people which is way more than the flight cost. On the plane, the staff is so rude. I asked for a glass of water to take my pill and they told me water costs 2 Euros. The same flight attendant was drinking from a big bottle of water behind the curtain.

"  We expected to arrive in Dubai by 0015 and board our onward flight to Kuwait by 0145. Our flight was expected to leave at 1415 from London Heathrow on 31st march, but departed at 1520. We expressed concerns to the staff in London and were assured that we would not miss our connecting flight. Onboard the flight the crew said they could not be certain if we will make the flight as it depends which Gate etc the flight would be on. This left us confused and apprehensive for the rest of our flight. As we arrived in Dubai at 0100, we were met by a Emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays. We chose this flight due to the short connection. If we wanted a longer layover, we would have booked it, but timing was important to us.

"  Qantas has deteriorated significantly in recent times, it is no longer a premium airline. Qantas now has an ageing fleet, fewer crafts, and serious staffing issues. This essentially means more cancellations, technical issues, delays, and a deteriorating service. We booked our tickets to Rome with Qantas as the flights selected had a convenient midday departure with a two-hour stopover in Sydney, and three hours in Dubai. However, problems started before we left home. 1) Qantas cancelled our first flight and rescheduled a departure time three hours earlier. The new 9.00am departure created a five-hour first stopover in Sydney 2) Qantas then delayed the Sydney departure due to 'engineering requirements' by four hours. They kept extending the delay every 30 minutes, making it impossible to modify onward journey arrangements. The stopover had extended to nine hours from two. 3) This resulted in missing our connecting flight in Dubai. We were rebooked into a flight scheduled to depart more than five hours later. 4) My wife and I were assigned separated seats, as the flight was full. Further to this, the Qantas flight service was extremely tardy. They kept forgetting to bring my wife's meal, which she received two hours after others had finished eating. The cabin was a constant mess as the cabin staff was extremely slow in removing trays, etc. 5) We arrived eight hours late in Rome and missed our connecting Alitalia flight. The result, Alitalia forfeited our return tickets that cost $1540 to replace. If you elect or need to travel Qantas, be prepared by lowering past expectations and factor in more delays.",Detractor

"  Madras to New York JFK return via Kuwait was my first time flying with Kuwait airways. The flight from Madras to Kuwait return (A340) was okay compared to the flight from Kuwait to New York return on a B747. There is no working in flight entertainment system for the flight to and fro NY though they had a small screen in front. Bad/broken seats, some of the staff are quite rude. The KWI-JFK flight landing at Shannon (Ireland) Airport came as a surprise for many of my co-passengers since it wasn't clearly mentioned in the ticket that there would be a stop in Dublin. There was also a delay in the flight from KWI-JFK. The passengers weren't explained why there was a delay. Security check done, bus is waiting downstairs, no passengers coming in to the gate, no work for almost 40-50 mins approx. I supposed they were waiting to pickup few other passengers from their other destinations and flights may have been delayed. There were no restrooms after the security check within the gate. Some of them were waiting to use the restroom at the flight. Since the flight was delayed, if they should use the restroom outside the lounge area of the gate they had to go through the whole process again. It caused big inconvenience to many. I think the flight is pretty much okay of it is your first time to fly and Kuwait Airways is your first ever company that you are flying with. For frequent fliers or for those who had already flown with other airlines it's a nightmare, at least to JFK which is their only destination in the US.

"  Paris to Milano. Sad to say that my experience is very dissapointing. I arrived at 6h00 at CDG airport with a scheduled flight at 7h30. After several fail attempts to check into my flight I go to an Alitalia counter. The very nice lady kindly directed me to the Air France counter because my flight was supposedly operated by them. After an hour of looking for my flight, (they could not find my name in the system,) they finally realized that my flight had been changed to an earlier time and I had not been informed of this change. I went to an Alitalia counter at the airport, where I had to deal with a very unpleasant attendant. I was nothing but polite to her when I explained my situation and all she said to me was, ""it is 7h05 you would've missed your flight anyway."" To which I responded, ""yes, because I have been bounced off from counter to counter for the last hour."" Without any explanation, or communication, she wrote some numbers on a piece of a paper and said ""your new ticket."" I asked if my return flight had also changed. Once again, no communication whatsover she wrote more numbers on the piece of paper. I had to once again ask how am I supposed to get my boarding pass, and she said ""counter 3, have a nice day."" I was the only person in the room, so is not like she had more people to take care of. This all happened at the purchasing tickets counter. Once again, the lady at the check-in counter was nice and gave me my boarding pass. When my second flight finally boarded, ahead of schedule I should point out. They tell us they have ""some issues they have to take care of."" I do not understand how is it possible for them to board an entire plane and then take care of issues. On top of that, the flight is now 20 minutes delayed. I wrote this entire review sitting on your plane. Perhaps my experience will change after departure, but as of right now, there has not been any apology, or explanation from your crew or company in regards to the time and business of your customers. I understand stuff happens, and sometimes is out of our control. But if your company decides to change a flight and not communicate it with the passengers.

Done 4 flight segments in 3 weeks DMM-IST IST-FCO BCN-IST and IST-DMM. Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737.

"  Rudest staff and most difficult time ever. We booked Spirit knowing they were a budget airline. We didn't want or need any extra accommodations, we thought.

When we showed up right on time for our flight, they informed us the plane had left early even though on their system, we were clearly there and checked in.

"My family and I were traveling to New Delhi, India in May from Newark and we were looking for a direct route from America to India to save time. The choices were between Air India and United. As we have tried Air India before, and we have not flown long haul with United for a long time, we decided to try out United's much touted ""new cabin experience"" in Economy class, where a ""three course meal"" would be presented, as well as improved services for Economy passengers. We had hoped United had improved since the last, disastrous time we flew them in 2013, but alas. It is the same lacklustre airline. Check in at EWR was relatively painless, and the TSA, is the TSA. We boarded and left relatively on time, and so far, things looked alright. And we were wrong about that. The 777-200 was old, to say the least, and in a shabby condition. The seats were worn and my recline didn't work- needless to say, for a 14 hour flight, this was simply not good enough, United. I was given a free drink to compensate, but a drink doesn't help you when you're stuck in an upright and uncomfortable position for 14 hours at 6 feet 3. My second gripe with this flight was the crew - and what a surly bunch they were. The ""three course meal"" much touted was not there - instead, we got served an awful mix of barbecue sauce and chicken, rice, and uncooked vegetables. There was no initial drinks run, and everything was served on one, tiny tray and due to this, our portion sizes were far too small. My son (aged 9) didn't eat anything for 12 hours. Breakfast was little better, with a choice between an uncooked omelette and an Indian vegetarian meal. The only saving grace of this flight was the IFE, but the screens were worn and did not respond to touch controls and the remotes in the armrest did not work. We have flown flights of similar length on Qatar or Emirates, and it is important to note how wonderful the food was, on those 16 hour voyages, and the plentiful snacks (I say ""snacks"", they were literally meals), and the courteous crews. There was none of that on a United flight of similar, or even longer length. The abysmal meals, disinterested and indifferent crews (who were nowhere to be seen after the initial meal service), and the shabby, worn condition of the plane and seats mean that I do not recommend United on such long haul flights of more than 10 hours.

Transiting at Istanbul airport is as painful as getting through packed Gulf hubs (as Doha and Abu Dhabi) but this is the unavoidable part of the journey! Just two cons: Most of cabin crew and ground staff at IST have really basic English skills. In Dec 2013 online check-in was not available at KL airport making the pre-flight experience a bit hectic.

The boarding process was rather chaotic with poor instructions on how sequential boarding is to be done. The in-flight entertainment system is poor (not much choice) and rarely updated. The food and beverages were just about average. On the return flight, however, SN602 on December 31, our experience was really bad. We had provided our food choices (vegetarian food and child meals), while booking the tickets. Thus, the airline had almost 9 months to prepare our meals. However, they ran out of vegetarian meals, which is simply because of bad planning and incompetence. What I was offered instead was non-vegetarian food",Detractor

So, I had to buy new round trip tickets for the next day from another airline at the last minute. The cost was much more expensive. They don't compensate the difference. I wasted my money for the round trip taxi fare from home to LAX and had to rebook the hotel at the destination. They refuse to compensate all the extra costs and the fare difference. A few years ago, one of major airlines cancelled my flight, rerouted me for next day flight but they provided one night hotel and food voucher.

Regarding the meals don't count with the what is served aboard because you will be disappointed. When we flow from Madrid to Miami the crew staff was rude, for dinner they served only one option of sandwich with cheese and pork which some of us couldn't eat - I asked if there any other option because I can't eat pork, one of the crew members told his colleague ""We have vegetarian sandwiches but if we will give him one, every one else on the plane will ask for one"".

"I read past reviews and learned that you need to read their guidelines in advance. I avoided the $100 fee to check in at the gate but still had to pay somewhere between $40 - $50 just for a seat and a carry on bag. Simply getting a seat is extra - this was still OK for me, the total price was still cheap considering I booked the flight a couple days before it left. After reading the reviews I was fully anticipating a 1.5 hour delay, or more. Somehow a miracle occurred and our flight left only 20 minutes late - and we made up those 20 minutes on the flight back. However, flying out of LAX I looked at every other scheduled departures for Spirit and all of them were delayed by at least 2hours. I truly believe that people only complain when things go wrong - I thought maybe this airlines bad reviews are simply because those who get to where they're going with no hiccups never bother writing reviews. With that in mind I had every intention of writing a review, no matter how good or bad the flight went. My flight was good, but the fact that all other flights were delayed by that much scares me. I overheard some of their announcements on further delays, and no explanation was given. I'm not going to fly Spirit again purely for that reason. You know something's wrong when an airline can scare away a traveler for reasons that didn't affect their own flight.",Passive
Absolutely terrible airline like riding a ragged city bus in the sky. Uncomfortable seats no leg room and rattled more than any other plane I've experienced. Extra fees everywhere.

"Flew with AirAsia from Chennai (Madras) to Kuala Lumpur. Quite a full flight. I'd checked in online and it was a breeze through the baggage drop as most passengers seemed to have decided to check in old skool style. Plane was loaded efficiently and departed on time. With a favourable tail wind and lack of air traffic, we arrived in KUL half an hour early. Unfortunately there was a plane in our parking slot which hadn't departed yet, so lost 15 mins. The seat on the plane was pretty standard Air Asia legroom and recline - not a great deal. But given the attractive price of my ticket, I'd say it was pretty good value for money. Couldn't really comment on the inflight service as I was asleep for the most part or playing games on my phone. As we seem to have been the first flight of the day arriving, some of the entry doors in the KLIA2 terminal were not opened, further eroding the gains from the early arrival. Quick through immigration and a long wait for baggage to be unloaded - this took about an hour. Also, quick through Customs checks.

"Late evening departure on BA28 from Hong Kong to Heathrow, plane fully booked (pre-Christmas season) in all classes. My seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my Christian name - I did not object, had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. During the flight I found out that the majority of the 14 pax in First class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. The purser offered the champagne welcome drink and I gladly accepted, and soon my face turned pale : the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. His apology came prompt, but too late. They simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour - or 30 minutes after takeoff - to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. British Airways did not control this service process properly. Maybe nobody was in charge, maybe it was simply forgotten. The plane had arrived in Hong Kong about 5 hours earlier, so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. The remaining flight was ok - cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team, food not sensational, but it was after midnight, so no complaints in this respect. Seat was fine, had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight, breakfast options okay, arrival ahead of schedule. So is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks? Yes, we are talking about first class in a leading European airline. The product has to be perfect, that's part of the game in first. Serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer. For me this means that it was most probably my last long distance flight on BA. No marks on inflight entertainment because I chose the sleep option.",Detractor

Amsterdam to Montreal was on MD-11 which surprised me since I didn't think that they were still in service. Food was adequate crew friendlier than those from Norwich. However after getting over the novelty of MD-11 I think KLM should seriously think of replacing them on such a busy long route as Montreal.

Nothing special but Ok. The Seat configuration was 2-4-2 and I sat on 27A. 20 minutes into the flight they had to restart the IFE because it was overheating. After 30 minutes of waiting, it could be used again. Another technical issue I noticed was that the USB ports didnÂ´t work, which was pretty annoying since I had a layover. However the IFE was pretty good. Especially there were so many good movies available that was incredible. Of course you had a moving map, TV Series etc. About 2h into the flight the crew served some food. As i sat on the back of the plane there was only 1 food option left, which was a Shepherd pie, it was delicious. It came with some salad, a bread bun and a cherry cake. The crew distributed drinks. After main course the crew dimmed the lights and we had to close our window shades. Shortly before landing the crew served either a Vanilla - or a spinach wrap with drinks. My layover in PHL was tiring but ok. At the gate there was no agent for a long time even at boarding time. So we had about 20-30 minutes delay, which was ok but I didntÂ´t knew the reason.

Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold.

"  Phuket to New York JFK via Beijing with Air China. This airline literally ruined the end of my vacation. First of all, the crew from the ticket counter to the airline stewardesses were rude. During the 13 hour flight, the food was disgusting and I was provided the equivalent of 2 dixie cups of water. When I asked for 2 more cups of water, I was told I was only allowed 1! When I asked the second time, I was told to go into the galley and get it myself. I have never been treated with such disrespect. On the way there, in my weariness from traveling 32 hours, I left my tablet in the seat pocket. When I called the airline once I got to the hotel and realized it was missing, I was told that it was not their responsibility and that I would have to deal with the Phuket airport. I called them and of course no one spoke english. Upon returning to the airport at the end of my trip, there was zero Air China customer service attendants to be found and their office was empty. To add insult to injury, while in Bejing on my 1 hour layover, the ticket attendant literally yelled at me and fellow passengers that we were 'slow' and needed to 'hurry up' to make our next flight to JFK - our plane had just arrived! Once getting to JFK, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I had to go to the Lufthansa counter to report my lost luggage becausee (surprise!) no Air China employees could be located. I was told that nothing was in the system tracking my bag and now, 4 days later, my bag is still no where to be found. I can't even file a missing bag claim with Air China because there is no customer service number and in order to file, you must mail or fax (what is this, 1980?) to a number that is provided by the local lost and found office which is unobtainable because no one answers the phone at JFK lost and found and no one returns calls.

I would like to enter a review of how the actual flight was, but I wouldn't know, because Frontier decided they wanted to cancel my flight 1 hour after it was supposed to depart. This is bad enough, but they then refused to refund the cost of the flight after they said they would. They handed me a paper saying they would reimburse the cost of my next flight up to $400 if I submitted my ticket. I did this, and two weeks later, I received a follow up email stating they would not refund the cost of my flight because it was cancelled by the ATC. I called customer service and they said I was a no show, which is a lie. Frontier doesn't care about the customer. I don't even think they care about money because the way they run their business is idiotic. In summary, I paid $200 to be told by their horrible customer service that I didn't show up to a flight that was cancelled, despite having the baggage tags to prove it. Unfortunately there is no option for negative value for money.",Detractor
"LHR-BKK-LHR. Started badly with all the Ryanairesque baggage warnings at Terminal 5. BA's low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. Seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food superb, best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for Â£65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again.",Detractor
AC869 11th July 2014 London Heathrow - Toronto. LHR-YYZ. Travelled to Toronto business class on new 787 seat was the best I have experienced in a long time good food on offer and great IFE. Only one problem beware of booking seats 5A + 5K on the 787 - these seats don't have any windows.,Passive
LHR-DXB-LHR. First flight on the Emirates A380. Compared to B777 seats were wider but legroom felt the same. Flight was quieter and smoother than B777. Check in in LHR was good with no queuing and friendly staff. Check-in in DXB no so good 20 minute queue with certain locals known to Airline staff being allowed to jump queue. Check in agent did not smile once. Boarding on both flights very efficient with no queuing or crowding on aircraft or airbridge. Service on outbound flight no so good no drinks served until after meal only one trolley drink service and no breakfast or food before early morning 6.30am arrival. Long wait for trays to be collected. Service on return better with drinks service before and after meal and light afternoon staff. Again long wait for trays to be cleared. Adequate number of toilets on flights with no significant queuing. In flight entertainment superb with good quality screen let down by poor control sensitivity.,Passive
BKK-KUL KUL-HKT BKK-HKT. Had booked for my girlfriend and myself to fly from BKK-HKT but had to change plans and flew BKK-KUL and KUL-HKT later on. Fast check-in at Suvarnabhumi at self-check-in terminals but extremely slow baggage drop-off! Flights were acceptable considering the reasonably low prices. No attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.,Detractor
"My wife and myself flew from Glasgow to Sydney return January and February 2015 on economy. The worst flying experience. Five Emirates flights and all of them delayed! On two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state ""due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served"" OK if you were business or first but economy forget it! On the last flight back from Bangkok to Dubai the flight was late arriving we were met by Emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. We were rushed through Dubai airport (very large airport and some of us had ailments) no transport arranged. When we reached the departure gate the staff there told us ""its too late for you to get on we did tell arrivals this!"" We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. We asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told ""you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only"". By the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. Emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. Our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline we have traveled on China Eastern and found the service much better than Emirates provide.",Detractor
"  Johannesburg - Abuja return on South African Airways A330-200 for both flights. After booking managing the booking online is a task as SAA webtool is not the easiest to manage. Check in staff at JNB very cold and could not care less this was at Premium Counters. Lounge at JNB good. Good selection of food and friendly staff. Boarding swift and flight departed on time. Probably helped by the fact that load was around 25% in both Y and J. Crew barring the Pursuer in Y extremely rude and disinterested. A reasonable meal served. Arrived in time into ABV. ABV Airport another story. Return, check in a mess. More to do with the mess in Nigeria on the whole. Same crew operating the return flight. Pursuer recognised me and gave a warm welcome. This was the highlight of trip. Again very poor load. Crew could not care less. IFE and food reasonable. On time arrival into JNB. SAA a good airline but being messed by staff at all levels. A sad story.",Passive
