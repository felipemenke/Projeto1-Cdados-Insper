" Singapore to Jakarta. 9 years since I last took Singapore Airlines. Online check-in process easy, I managed to call the hotline to change my seat to get an exit row with my parents which was done easily. SQ did even bother to send us an SMS to warn us about the French strikes blocking the roads and to go early to the airport subsequently. Very good point. I find the quality of service onboard below of that of few years ago, food standard and bland, staff with good hard-skills though (responsive, efficient and professional) but could be better - they talk very fast, robotic gestures and could be more smiling. On our inbound leg, they ran out of one food option which left us very disappointed. Seats on the Boeing 777-300ER larger and more comfortable compared with that of other premium airlines. For the outbound Jakarta-Singapore leg, they asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight, so that we could have more buffer time transiting in Singapore for our next flight to Paris and not being too much in a hurry, which was a very good point. All in all, very good ground service, but experience onboard quite standard. I place this experience on par with 4-star airlines such as Emirates, but below the 5-Star Qatar Airways. Good value for money though.",Passive
Norwegian Long Haul. OSL-LGW. Flight DY1310. 11th July. 787-800 Dreamliner. Having taken delivery of their first 787 EI-LNA on 30th. June Norwegian offered passengers the chance of shorthaul European 'Dreamliner' flights for the summer before they deploy them to the USA/Far East. I took advantage of the offer and was not disappointed. Checking in very easy at Gardermoen airport with plenty of kiosks. Boarding delayed due we were informed to a problem with the air conditioning. However the fault (human or mechanical?) was quickly solved and we were invited to board earlier than announced. Being a nearly new aircraft everything was in pristine condition except for the two window controls next to me. The 'Smart Glass' refused to dim on one window despite much pressing and only just worked on the other but did not get fully dark. I feel the control pads are not robust enough and were already worn out. Takeoff was as smooth as silk and done in a very short time. The flight was very calm and the usual aircraft roar absent. The touch screen seat-back entertainment was easy to use and had a very good sky map which could be viewed in several different ways: Normal R/L side Top view Cockpit view etc. The menu had films games in-flight purchases and so on. All in all a wonderful two hour flight.,Promoter
"  Guangzhou to Paris. I have paid for inflight upgrade service from economy to business class. Under the upgrade agreement the food would be as economy, but crew were served me extra meal and fruits, sandwich. If China Southern could prepare more per-meal for temporary upgrade it would be better. Headset with noise-cancelling are good but do not work well all the time, changed two times during flight. Movies with long advertisement disturbed 3 times. Ground services staff is quite patient with my luggage and mileage question.",Promoter
 Vientiane to Melbourne via Bangkok. A very enjoyable flight that began with check in - I love that they have a much shorter line for bag drop for those who have checked in online. Friendly staff. Meals were good and varied and plentiful with good drink options and they came back for coffee after the meal. Wide choice of movies and tv shows provided through inseat screen. Flight arrived early in Melbourne. Would definitely fly again.,Promoter
I travelled Manchester - Sydney return on 777-300 ER. The service was mediocre on 3 of the 4 legs with a poor selection of food warm champagne and no single malts. The crew were almost robotic and did not show any real deep customer care. The service was rushed and served without any finesse unlike Singapore and Emirates. The new seat/bed was ok but felt tight and squeezed in. Obviously on this airline they have crammed in as many seats as possible with no space to move around the plane. I am 1.80 in height and slim and getting in and out of my seat 17K unless the seat was completely upright was a struggle. Boarding on all 4 legs as a BC passenger was chaotic and a stress. In Hong Kong it was unbelievable. 14 staff and not one singing off the same hymn sheet. Also in HK no one welcomed us onboard either on entry or when we were seated. The crew manager spent all her time at the front of the plane and never entered to serve or speak with the passengers in any class on the HK to Manchester leg on 18 Feb 2015. She was unapproachable and aloof. The business class lounge at Manchester was a joke and in Hong Kong was nice when inside the staff were distant and robotic. In Sydney we used the Qantas lounge winch was a delight. I would not spend Â£3700 with this airline again but will travel Singapore or Emirates BC when I travel long haul and wouldn't use Manchester again I'll travel through Heathrow.,Passive
"AC1830 Toronto to Bridgetown 24 April 2014. AC1831 Bridgetown to Toronto 4 May 2014. Like many others posting I booked flights for myself and my husband months in advance of our April 2014 trip to Barbados. When I booked I paid for an Air Canada flight - not an Air Canada Rouge flight. As I understand it Air Canada Rouge didn't even fly into Barbados at the time I booked. We were subsequently bumped to Air Canada Rouge with no consultation and no refund. I had upgrade credits to get us to Premium Rouge so the trip down wasn't too bad (except for the lack of entertainment) but the trip back in economy was terrible. My husband was forced to sit sideways (to the extent possible) in order to avoid jamming his knees into the seat ahead. Clearly AC didn't get anyone over 6 feet to test the comfort of these seats before they decided to alter the planes. So we got a ""discount"" service with no discount!",Detractor
SIN-DPS-SIN. New B777 with 3-3-3 in economy vs 3-4-3 with Emirates giving plenty of room width ways and I could quite comfortably stretch out length ways. Nice cabin interior cabin crew responded quickly to the call button. Meal adequate for a two and a half hour flight in Y class. No news papers or magazines but the Oryx inflight entertainment would keep you from getting bored. Baggage allowance of 23kg adequate for a long weekend in Bali but Emirates and Etihad are now giving 30kg. Business class seats looked wide and comfortable compared to Etihad's which are a bit narrow. I look forward to flying on Qatar Airways again they are now on my favourite airline list.,Promoter
"Our last trip with Garuda Indonesia, return Jeddah to Jakarta, both flights exceeded our expectations. The crew were helpful and friendly at all times. The food is good but the portion sizes need to be increased. For sitting comfort, the seat needs to be more flexible and more adjustable in the recline position. We travelled Economy class, but the were spoilt with welcome drinks, good food and great movies. Overall, I will recommend Garuda Indonesia.",Promoter
  We booked our flights in July 2016 with Alaska. It's February 2017. From Kona to Seattle they had the family split up including our 5 year old. They did not care at all (that's the way flights work she said they have to make money). Then the flight attendant prosseded to give my 5 year old pop every time he would ask but my wife and I were not sitting in same row and could not see. My wife got to sit beside 2 people that had to use belt extensions - it was fun for her. When we got to Seattle they had seats for us - one for me but the kids and wife they oversold. They know when you book flights how old people are so the idea of splitting up a mother or father and a 5 year old is ridiculous. The other part is how do you oversell a seat when you book it 8 months early.,Detractor
" I now avoid British Airways under Alex Cruz and this is the first time I have flown EasyJet to Copenhagen. It was broadly comparable in comfort and service, while being significantly cheaper. I'd also choose over Ryanair as the aircraft interior is less garish and there are fewer annoying announcements.",Passive
"  Guangzhou to New York on October 14th with China Southern Airlines. As a gold member this was an excellent service. My experience met my requirement, the crew were absolutely superb.

April 30 from Amsterdam to Shanghai. Flight left 30 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early. As usual FA's professional friendly and efficient. Food acceptable drinks plentiful. No issues whatsoever. Managed to sleep a couple of hours which is nice on a red-eye flight.,Promoter
I flew from Jakarta to Sydney in Business Class and it was fantastic! The cabin seat food and flight attendants were world class. The only fault I could find was that there was no 'flight tracker' option on the AVOD system. Other than that I had a great experience and look forward to flying with Garuda Indonesia again soon.,Promoter
"  San AndrÃ©s Island to BogotÃ¡. After arriving at the gate I was told to wait. I peeped to see what was going on and the crew was on their laptop playing some game. They were visibly embarrassed that some of us noticed them so they put on a charm offensive which did not last long. More than half an hour after take off and well after the seat belt signs were out they still had not open the front toilet. I was in 1A and was hoping to use it but could not ask them to open it because they had by now congregated in the back galley. Eventually they said I had to use the rear toilet because they needed to do a 'security procedure' (which was to feed the pilot and co-pilot). After this they still did not open the toilet and then congregated In the front galley chatting away very loudly with the curtain drawn as if we passengers were irrelevant to them. They seat belts signs then went on for the rest of the flight. They looked delighted because they just sat and chantted away and did not have to hand out food or drinks to us. Never seem crew so irresponsible, indifferent and careless.",Detractor
"Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways, and not overly happy with the experience. The A380 is an impressive jet, but despite paying the extra for Premium Economy the seats are like torture. It is impossible to get comfortable so sleep is not just elusive but impossible. Didn't feel that the Premium Economy experience was of any great value. Staff attentive and food reasonable.",Detractor
AC1900 Toronto to Athens on July 17 return on AC1901 on Aug 7. Our flight on AC Rouge to Athens was comfortable and we found the staff to be friendly and competent. As others have commented the seats are close together but my husband and I were comfortable (I'm 5'ft 4â€ he is 5 ft 11â€). The food and beverages were fine (meals included spicy pasta with a small salad or chicken breast with vegetables light snack included warmed wraps). We were regularly offered water during the 10 hour flight. With the Rouge app downloaded in advance the entertainment is fine. We had no trouble connecting to in-flight entertainment during our flight. Our son has an allergy to peanuts and having read the reviews on this site we were concerned for the cleanliness of the seats (potential cross contamination causing an allergic reaction) and the competence of the staff. Anyone with serious allergies will understand the level of worry that comes without access to medical assistance for a long period. On both our outgoing and return flights the flight attendants were very attentive and in both cases asked passengers sitting close to us to refrain from eating nuts which we greatly appreciated. We didn't use the blankets and pillow provided (brought our own) and brought allergy free food for my son so we didn't require any special or additional attention from AC.,Promoter
" We had an exceptional flight with Emirates from DÃ¼sseldorf to Dubai. The service on board was on point, the staff were friendly and helpful. The A380 was modern and it offered a lot of legroom. The inflight entertainment was amazing and offered a lot of new movies. Only the wifi on board was a negative on this flight.",Promoter
"Flew Aer Lingus from Dublin to Madrid to Dublin, Feb 5-7th. Flights were packed but I was delighted to see the introduction of ""priority boarding"" which comes if you purchase certain seats at the time of booking, found it very handy. Crew were very good on both flights, however the new in-flight menu has virtually nothing on it, no fruit salad and my colleague who is vegetarian could order nothing. Both flights were virtually on time, but it would be worth it if Aer Lingus reviewed their in-flight buy on board menu - remember Ireland has a weath of culinary riches.",Promoter
"Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco. We departed more or less on time, something of a minor miracle at Frankfurt where you frequently feel that you've driven halfway to your destination before you reach the runway. We were upstairs on the A380 which was pleasant. The upstairs economy cabin is relatively small (only 40 or so seats) and feels quiet and relaxed. The seats were OK, not the best legroom and a touch on the narrow side, but not too bad. I would certainly recommend trying to get seats upstairs on the A380. The entertainment system worked well with a reasonable choice. The food was dreadful - other airlines manage to serve meals that taste of something, it's about time that Lufthansa managed to do the same. All in all, not bad, but sadly let down by the food.",Passive
" London Heathrow to Perth via Hong Kong. You learn a lot about a business when things go wrong. I've learned today that CP struggle greatly to deal with difficulties. My premium economy flight was originally scheduled for 17:15, to Perth via Hong Kong, but was subject to repeated delays until my connection was under threat. The people in the lengthy queue at the desk informed me the flight was unlikely to leave and that staff were rebooking people to other flights, even other airlines. I waited for more than two hours in the queue, eventually to be told that there were two options available . I could take the first leg in the 5 hour delayed original flight, with no onward connection available until 24 hours after the original, resulting in a full day delay. My other option was to fly another airline, to Sydney via Singapore, with a lengthy wait there until a connection to Perth, the latter leg in economy and around 14 hours delay. No upgrades were offered, despite those delays and the inconvenience. I asked about being upgraded and was very reluctantly offered business class on the first leg only, on the first option. That, apparently, is the very best they could do for me. During the conversation I was invited to explore other routes and options myself online if I thought I could do better, told that I should appreciate that they hadn't deliberately planned this disruption and informed that they were dealing with lots of people in the same situation - as though I was somehow not appreciating fully their problems and being rather selfish in the circumstances. I won't be flying with them again after this trip And I'll be spreading the word around our Australia-based business - not because they had a problem with my flight but because their response to it was haphazard and unsatisfactory.",Detractor
"  Phuket to New York JFK via Beijing with Air China. This airline literally ruined the end of my vacation. First of all, the crew from the ticket counter to the airline stewardesses were rude. During the 13 hour flight, the food was disgusting and I was provided the equivalent of 2 dixie cups of water. When I asked for 2 more cups of water, I was told I was only allowed 1! When I asked the second time, I was told to go into the galley and get it myself. I have never been treated with such disrespect. On the way there, in my weariness from traveling 32 hours, I left my tablet in the seat pocket. When I called the airline once I got to the hotel and realized it was missing, I was told that it was not their responsibility and that I would have to deal with the Phuket airport. I called them and of course no one spoke english. Upon returning to the airport at the end of my trip, there was zero Air China customer service attendants to be found and their office was empty. To add insult to injury, while in Bejing on my 1 hour layover, the ticket attendant literally yelled at me and fellow passengers that we were 'slow' and needed to 'hurry up' to make our next flight to JFK - our plane had just arrived! Once getting to JFK, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I had to go to the Lufthansa counter to report my lost luggage becausee (surprise!) no Air China employees could be located. I was told that nothing was in the system tracking my bag and now, 4 days later, my bag is still no where to be found. I can't even file a missing bag claim with Air China because there is no customer service number and in order to file, you must mail or fax (what is this, 1980?) to a number that is provided by the local lost and found office which is unobtainable because no one answers the phone at JFK lost and found and no one returns calls. Long story short, saving money is not worth it. The $200 I had saved has now cost me over $2500 in lost valuables with no remediation.",Detractor
"  Hamilton Island to Sydney. Check In was quick and easy. There is no business class lounge at Hamilton island but this is not an issue as the check in time before departure is quite short. Flight was a little late boarding whilst the plane was cleaned. Flying a B717 was a first for me but was comfortable and smooth. Qantas had supplied Ipads for the inflight entertainment, although the battery was flat on mine, so I used another. In flight service was excellent. Good view of Sydney on final approach to airport. Flight arrived on schedule and bags were on the belt by the time we had walked to it.",Promoter
" CUR-AMS with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines: Night flight. Started a little bit later but arrived 45 min. before schedule. Ground and onboard service very kind, food was average, but we had brought own provisions, mainly because they are not able to combine at least two food restrictions (for instance low carb and gluten free). Entertainment was poor, earphones same scrap as on the inflight. As I always bring my own comfortable down cushion, I manage to sleep even in Economy seats, so that was no problem. AMS-FRA: Started a bit later, same annoying snack as on the inflight, of course. Waited very long for the luggage, luckily we checked it on the spot, found one of our trunks demolished and reported it to the counter. That went well and was served kindly, now we wait for the refund.",Promoter
We went with 6 people (4 adults and 2 children). We accidentally had two pieces of luggage too much (this was our own fault) so we paid the extra other airlines do the same so its not just Ryanair. Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them? Do they do it on purpose maybe hoping they get the full service and not paying for it? I like Ryanair they bring you very safely from A to B for very little money. I don't expect much from them but I am always surprised they give good service for the money you pay.,Promoter
7/7/2014 ORD-FCO AZ0629. 17/7/2014 FCO-ORD AZ6028. I would never recommend flying Alitalia! Plane was very old. Plane was very dirty food all over floor when we boarded. Only 3 out of 6 restrooms were in working order and those were filthy. Not cheap tickets so I expect much more. Heard lots of complaints from the passengers so we weren't the only ones who were very disappointed.,Detractor
"  New York to Orlando was the best short haul flight I've taken. Cabin crew were friendly, casual but efficient. I was amazed by the retrofitted cabin design and how bright it was. Overhead bin was massive and a carry-on suitcase could fit sitting on the side of the suitcase instead of flat as they normally do. I appreciated when the crew kindly reminded every passenger to get to their seat as soon as possible and move away from the aisle to speed up the boarding process, since we started boarding a few minutes behind the scheduled boarding time but arrived in Orlando 20min early. The entertainment system was very amazing and it's even better than those on long haul international flights. Big screen and a lot of movies to choose from. Free non-alcoholic beverage and snack is a common practice in US domestics flights. I will choose Delta again.",Promoter
" London to Shanghai via Frankfurt, on the first flight, I was seated in the last row in 32F. The flight was reasonably smooth with the usual meat/cheese sandwich provided and landing about 20 minutes early. The connection time was about 2 hours but the secure area we were in had very few facilities: a small restaurant, McDonalds and Heinemann Duty Free. On the flight to Shanghai, I was sat on the aisle. The food was incredibly salty with the smell of BBQ sauce wafting through the cabin. It was a night flight and of course we couldn't sleep but the movie selection had clearly not been updated. The seats were relatively comfortable and the service was quintessentially German. The flight landed on time.",Passive
"Flew Economy on BKK-PVG-FRA and return. The ticket price was very cheap. Seat Pitch is okay PVG airport Terminal 1 is a bit soul less and don't expect to find much to keep you busy but transfer was okay food on the aircraft is bad but edible if needed. Suggest that you stock up before the flight. IFE was okay on the A330 not excellent but fair the short haul fleet has no such service except for overhead monitors. No amenity sets handed out so take your tooth brush with you. Drink choice includes beer and wine ""made in china"" and soft drinks. No spirits. Flights were on time and check in and boarding was normal. All in all it is a bit like an LCC flight with only basic service features. Baggage allowance is very generous even so I did not take advantage of it. Service was not brilliant but I guess okay by Chinese Standards command of English is basic.

" Moscow to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Truly satisfying experience. The planes are very new and clean. All flights on time. Very professional ground staff and cabin crew. Very useful assistance during transfer in Abu Dhabi. Extremely comfortable seats. The entertainment system is great - lots of excellent movies and music, not a single chance to get bored. Quite interesting inflight magazine too. There are things to work on, though. The food quality have dropped significantly during the last couple of years - the meal was surprisingly mediocre and not tasty. Also, the Etihad mobile application tends to crash and depict errors causing the necessity to dial the call center for simple operations. The call center is rather useless though. For example I had failed to change my seats via application and asked to do so via call center, but the guy there was trying persistently to convince me, that the seating I required was not possible. Of course the issue was solved in 1 minute by the ground staff at the airport, luckily the seats that I wanted were still available.",Promoter
Dublin to Toronto return. Okay the seats aren't the most comfortable in the world too thin and seem to lean slightly too far forward but otherwise I had no issues and my back survived both ways. There is less space overall on the plane compared to other transatlantic flights but I was still able to get up and walk around. I was aware before hand that you needed an iPad to watch the inflight entertainment so I had books etc with me instead. The food is the best airline food I've had on any flight. The staff were pleasant and polite and in dealing with one passenger with special needs on the return flight were the best I've seen on any airline. I would fly with them again. In addition unlike certain airlines - the staff were up and down the aisles frequently with extra water for passengers.,Promoter

Flew Turkish Airlines for the first time in December Business Class from Dhaka to Vienna return Paris to Dhaka. We were disappointed in a number of things.

The rap highlight however was the Istanbul lounge which must be amongst the best in the world. Fabulous food and services.,Passive
"  All the additional fees are clearly stated before you purchase tickets! It's a ""bare fare"", if you want luxury - buy tickets for a triple price from different airline. I was more than satisfied with our flight from Atlanta to Boston, and back. The flights were on time, arriving even earlier than anticipated. Customer service was superb, flight attendants cracking jokes, very courteous. I have read the bad reviews before our trip and was afraid, but decided that financial benefit in my situation is bigger than bad reviews. I would fly Spirit Airlines with no hesitation next time. Great job! I am sorry people cannot read what is included and what is not, and complain about their own mistakes. The one and only note - the seats are uncomfortable.",Promoter

Flew LHR to Larnaca and return 22nd April and 29th April in Club Europe. I had high hopes for Business class albeit shortish haul but was somewhat disappointed. Legroom not quite what I expect from Business class 34 inches is hardly room to stretch out. The service was good but the choice of food was limited and again not what I expect from a business class experience. As for inflight entertainment? Oh dear. On a 4.5 hour flight I expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. If you didn't like the film tough. All in all I will not rush to pay the extra.,Passive
Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A. Either way it is best to avoid Southwest Airlines at all costs.,Detractor

Not that the bag would have been bigger in volume than the one allowed, only it wasn't the correct form but would have still fit the overhead compartment just fine. Also a couple of people who had bought tax free products at the airport and now had to check in their bags because the extra plastic/paper bag they were carrying also had to be in their cabin bag .

The flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but I'm not sure they made it to the final rows. I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). I still don't think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew's fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal.

Every bag you have is extra money checked bags carry on bags and they tell you none of this until after you have bought your ticket. It even costs money to print your boarding pass at the airport. Your carry on can weigh 50 lbs which costs you different amounts based on when and where you tell them you have a carry on. Then if you check a bag it costs you another 50 bucks if it weighs over 40lbs! I have flown plenty this is by far the worst experience I have had with an airline.,Detractor
" Amsterdam to Vancouver. This airline and customer care centre has been nothing but a whirlwind and they do not have a customer care centre. I have been writing and phoning and waiting since October 9th 2017 for my case to be sorted out and it is now January 9th 2018. When I landed from Amsterdam to Vancouver part of my bag was missing and I went straight away to KLM desk they told me I need make police report at airport soo I did then KLM said I need to call customer care but every time I call there is no way to get real person to talk to in customer care and I wrote emails after emails when someone finally calls me they say u need feel out this and that form but I already did, it's like they just put me though to someone else. I finally got someone to handle the case and they said the case is closed and we will send you a cheque for your lost items. That was at beginning of November and it's now January and when I call or write they say the cheque it's in mail. But it's in the mail from November 10th to January 9th to me this don't make sense and the customer service from KLM Delta has been the worst in my life. I will not recommend this to anyone.",Detractor
"  This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed Fleet"". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken curry was served but I still don't see it as Biz class food. A choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. The jury remains out on whether I continue my loyalty to BA and One World - it really depends on what BA do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - I'm off).",Passive

Dinner was served shortly after take-off and a couple hours later there was a snack-service with cup noodles. The western style breakfast served two hours prior arrival was tasty and plentiful.

Most seats are broken and I flew almost with my front neighbours seat in my face. Toilets smell - a bonus.

The food is close to vile and prices are ridiculous - 14 euros! Captain did not say anything during our flight. Most seats were broken and arm rests taped! 1st flight our plane still smelt of cigarette - looked like a plane from the 80s. Funny thing tickets were not that cheap either!

The next morning, the rebooked flight was canceled, again she was at the airport before they announced it. Delta rerouted her through multiple airports.

Furthermore, AA agent lied about refunding me for my first class ticket. When I persisted, he claimed the puddle jumper they had put me on had nothing but first class seating! Not only are they dishonest, they apparently think their customers are idiots. This is exactly the reason I switched to Delta several years ago.

Economy from CPH-AMS-SIN on Fokker 70 and B777. CPH-AMS good short flight on time and with a little snack. FA very friendly. AMS-SIN slightly delayed departure and arrival into Singapore but explained and kept informed. FA very friendly and with frequent drink patrols. Food was among better I have ever had in economy. Toilets kept clean. I didn't use IFE that much but seemed responsive and good with average content. The seats was really good. Slightly on the hard side and a footrest would have been appreciated.

" Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available. There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us, we wouldn't have spent two hours on the floor. Onboard, the Business Class was in a 2-3-2 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class, I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite, but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good. No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE, there is the same ad as in Eco.

I recently booked a 9.30am trip to Amarillo through American Airlines (booked it 2 months in advance). The morning of the flight at about 6.30am (while I was headed to the airport) I was called by American Airlines and it was an automated voice recording telling me that my flight had been cancelled and they automatically put me on a 6.30pm flight that night. I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place). I ended up having to book another flight through Southwest Airlines last minute (costing me a fortune) just to make it to the city in time.

" Paris to Reunion. This was a last minute leisure trip so I paid quite a high amount of money (3,800â‚¬ round trip), compared to other AF Business seats, to go to La Reunion. I am not a big fan of Orly airport but SkyPriority worked very well until the Skyteam Lounge. Although quite small, it was very cosy with a bay window over the check-in hall. Food and beverages were not fantastic but enough to wait quietly for my flight which was 20mn late (not Air France fault though). Onboard, I experienced the old Business Class seat which I already knew when I booked (the Best&Beyond is rare if simply not existent for the French abroad territories). It still a bit baffling. Business class was full this day (14 seats) and, since it's a family destination, full of kids, at least half the cabin. I honestly think kids should not be allowed in Business but those ones were calm during the entire flight so I cannot complain. The flight attendant was nice and caring but nothing extraordinary. She promptly brought our nice dishes. I had pre-ordered a meal and everything was good in this area. Concerning the IFE, I was honestly surprised by the low quantity of movies available but it didn't really matter for me, since I soon went to sleep on this 11h flight. Everything went well upon arrival and even though it was a bumpy flight on an old slippery seat (because of the inclination), I was quite fresh and ready to enjoy my vacation.",Promoter

"This was my sixth time with Korean Air to New Zealand and my preferred option. London to Seoul returns were only 70% full so had 3 seats to myself both legs which made for very comfortable flights. Seoul to Auckland flights both full, but comfortable enough seats and good leg room. The food service was fine - the Bibimbap is always my choice with hot pepper paste to spice it up and very good. Proper cutlery and glasses a good touch. Drinks offered but spirits not on the carts and had to be fetched from the galley, wine offered and they came round to top up. Don't usually bother with inflight entertainment, but the range offered didn't seem stand out, but USB port available on seat back to charge a phone was useful touch. The standout are the cabin crew. Courteous, polite and consistently good. There is a genuine feeling that they are pleased to be of service to you. And the bonus for me was that on the return as there is no same day connection from Auckland to London the airline puts passengers up at a 5 star hotel, this time the Central Park in Songdo, 30 minutes from airport. The transfer was efficient, easy instructions for what to do on arrival in Seoul. The hotel was fantastic, dinner and breakfast provided on an as much as you like basis, and the room was amazingly comfortable, a nice bonus to break up the long journey home.

"Purchased tickets well in advance for a trip to Hawaii from Chicago. Upgraded tickets to First Class knowing that special perks are included (free luggage, etc). Over the months, United Airlines sent me a number of schedule changes and most were not an issues. However, the return flight from OGG to ORD via HNL has become a problem not only because they kept moving the time earlier and earlier (remember, I'm on vacation in Hawaii), but put us on Island Air which only offers economy class and charge for baggage ($80.00 for our 4 bags). This is unacceptable and in my opinion, quite unfair. I called UA's customer service and am so disappointed with the level of customer service or lack of that I received. The agent was difficult to understand due to her heavy accent and was in some ways, quite rude. Take or leave it attitude. Although she offered to move our flight to a different connection through LAX, she stated we would have to pay the difference since we upgraded to first class. How is this right? She told me that she couldn't do anything and when I explained that I have a 3.5 hour layover and that I would have to pay for bags, she didn't have any solutions for me. Rather she argued with me, told me she would talk to a supervisor, put me on hold only to come back and say that it was going to a considerable hold since her supervisor wasn't available and then continued to state she would be happy to cancel my flight altogether and refund me, but I would lose my upgrade that I used. Then she tells me that my husband's status means that we get one bag each checked free. I inquired how does this help me if I'm flying a different airline? She had no answer and again offered to cancel my tickets for a refund. How is this a solution? Her last solution was to call Island Air. Honestly, United Airlines used to be such a great airline - what has happened? Where did customer service go? What benefits do you get anymore for being loyal to an airline and actually paying to maintain a higher status (silver)? We are so disappointed.

" For our city trip to Singapore from Frankfurt we decided to fly with Lufthansa. The Boarding in Frankfurt was a little bit chaotic as all Economy passengers boarded at the same time. In Singapore it was done by row which was much better. The plane itself was okay. The meals were also good but only good. There are airlines with better meals in economy but also others with meals which are not as good as the meals with Lufthansa. The Seats we had, 96k and 96h on the upper deck were worth the money as it was pretty quiet and the service offered by the crew was great. The most dissapointing thing was the inflight entertainment system which seems to be a bit old and slow. Also the selection of music and films compared to other airlines was not very good. It was enough to survive the 12 hours flight but not as good as expected. Overall I would choose Lufthansa again.",Passive
A very comfortable flight with Cathay Pacific Airways from London Heathrow to Hong Kong in premium economy. Lots of leg room even when the person in front reclined. The food was adequate but I do not like the trend of only ice cream for dessert and there was no cheese and crackers. On the return journey they said they had run out of meal choices and there were only 10 people in the cabin! Luckily they found the meal of choice from somewhere. I travel to Hong Kong regularly and like the many choices of flight times that Cathay offers. The flight back was not full so was even more comfortable. All flights were on time and the luggage arrived safely. I will happily use Cathay again.,Promoter
CX829 and CX723 YYZ to HKG and onto KUL on 24 Aug. In contrast to the outgoing flight I must say I was more than satisfied with my return flight. Early morning departure from Toronto we were the last flight to leave. Full flight boarding was organized and efficient and the ground staff were pleasant and accommodating. I had an empty seat next to me which helped. The meals were disappointing in terms of size but were tasty. Snacks were provided on the 15 hour flight to HKG but you had to ask. Good quality shortbread cookies and hot cup noodles were provided. Staff were pleasant and the cabin manager was very sweet. As I had a cold she made me a cup of tea with honey and lemon and checked on me later to ask if I wanted another one! Seats were ok not great and in flight entertainment was adequate. No real complaints. All flights were on time toilets were clean so all in all a slick operation.,Promoter
SQ 15 - Sep 29. SQ402 - Oct 1. SQ5357 Oct 24. SQ16 - Oct 25 2014. I have been flying SQ from San Francisco to India since 1990 when they had their 747-400 Megatop almost once or twice a year. Other airlines have cut down on service rudeness of the cabin crew has increased and fares have skyrocketed. In SQ the service and amenities always amaze me a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way. Similarly the dessert (which is usually ice cream) comes an hour after meals.,Promoter

JNB-CAI Feb 21. Overnight A332 flight to Cairo on somewhat beat up aircraft. Egyptair requires that your checked bags be wrapped in plastic - they provided this service at JNB free of charge but do not disclose that ahead of check-in. Boarding was on time and fine. Combination of male and female FA's. The female FA's do the majority of the service. Due to flight length I did not take the main meal. Sadly too much time was devoted to this leaving cabin lights on over 2 hours on a short 7.5 hour flight. Only served 1 glass of water until breakfast service so recommend taking on board water if not at an aisles seat. Breakfast service was disorganized. Breads and coffee primarily. Cabin was in rough shape. Approximately 20 percent of seats had to be manually adjusted by FA's. Recliner seat was ok but not ideal for overnight flight. Lavatory was dingy and Kleenex stocked for hand towels. Timing of flight makes for ideal routing between the two locations so recommend based on schedule.,Passive
"I booked this flight from Milan Malpensa to Cancun via Madrid through their website and the first thing happened was that they have booked the flight twice and charged my credit card accordingly. After calling their call center I was able to get the money back, but in more then a week, and we are not talking 100â‚¬ here. The big surprise was when I arrived in Milan at the airport. Online when checking in I couldn't give my frequent flyer number so I said I will do everything at the airport. The lady at the priority check in very rudely tells me that my reservation has been cancelled and she asks me to go and provide her a valid reservation number looking very busy, although there was no client anywhere. So I call Iberia again, after 8 minutes waiting in line they tell me that everything has been resolved and I should go to the check in desk again. I go this time to the normal check in desk and there is another lady, same style. She says my flight is in 3h30m and I should get back in 1h30m otherwise she can't check in the bags. I didn't need any bags, I just wanted my boarding card, so she has to somehow leave her ""doing nothing"" and she issues the tickets. I should say I have told her to insert my FF number before issuing the tickets, 3 times, without any success. She first issued the boarding passes and then at the end my card number. This caused me a lot of problems, first at the business lounge in Milan where they couldn't read my oneworld status. In Madrid I found out that the FF number inserted was wrong (a 7 too much) and while trying to fix this, they've told me the system is not working and that they will fix it later. when it was fixed, it was in Madrid when returning and they have given me the right number just for the last part MAD MXP, for all the other legs I should contact them via internet. I was pretty sure I will get my miles 3 months after this, but it turned out to be different. I got them a week after I returned home. Now, about the flights. The planes were new and the A340-600 was impressive. 2-4-2 configuration. The crew very attentive and friendly, active at customer's needs. The food wasn't great (only one meal for 13h) and the breakfast was a joke: a box with different cold snacks. I must say I was impressed by the punctuality. Arrived on time or even 30 min ahead of schedule. So thumbs up for the flights, thumbs down for the ground service.

Booked a trip through Sunwing going from Edmonton to Ixtapa because it was supposed to be a direct flight this year. A couple of weeks before we were to leave we were told that we had to stop in Calgary. We were not too happy with this because we had to depart Edmonton an hour and a half earlier. What could we do at this point. The flight was just about an hour late leaving Edmonton. Once we landed in Calgary they had to do a crew change and then there were issues with the paperwork. About an hour delay again. Arrived in Ixtapa about 40 minutes later than was previously scheduled. Coming home we left the hotel at about 1.20 pm and didn't fly out from Ixtapa until 6 pm. The flight was scheduled to leave at 5.20 pm. Delays again because of paperwork. Late getting into Edmonton again also because of crew change issues in Calgary. We have flown Sunwing many times in the past but this is the first time we have had any issues. The resort we stayed at was excellent and would definitely go back again but worried at what the Sunwing flight will be like next time.,Passive
SIN-FRA-BHX in Economy. First leg from Singapore on the A380 was great largely because I was fortunate enough to get an exit row seat with unlimited legroom (judging by fellow passengers one wouldn't be happy with normal seats as they had rather pathetic legroom). Nice modern AVOD system but the PTVs were rather small compared to other A380 airlines. Service was really friendly and warm but few frills (no amenity kit whatsoever no footrests). Meals were alright but again rather simple compared to Asian carriers. Second leg to Birmingham on an A320 was above average by intra-Europe standards with a decent snack/beverage service and friendly service again. All flights on time.,Passive
Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.,Detractor

Bangkok to JFK out of necessity rather than choice. I typically fly business but could not justify the price especially after reading the reviews. My decision was justified. Bangkok to JFK leg was not as bad as I expected but the food quality service and entertainment were substandard when measured against other Star Alliance carriers. (I am a Star Alliance Gold Member). The nightmare was the return trip. Upon arriving to JFK I was informed that I would miss my connection from Beijing to Bangkok because the flight was delayed and I was ticketed on the next available flight which required me spending the night in Beijing at Air China's expenses. When I landed there was no CA agent at the gate to help direct you. Second the transfer desk personnel could not provide clear instructions of what to do and several of us spent 1.5 hrs going through a maze trying to find someone who could direct us properly. Took almost 2 hours to get us to the hotel. Upon arriving to Bangkok my bag was lost and 36 hours later I am still waiting. A disappointing experience and no value for money.,Detractor

The food was remarkable for my pre-order meals. The in-flight entertainment is up to date and it allowed to catch up on the movies that I missed in cinemas. The crew, both on the ground and in flight are attentive to the needs of the passengers. I am quite fascinated that the check-in crew because they also ensured that I would not encounter any conflict during my return flight by inspecting if my visa is valid and counterchecked it with management and immigration. It was a smooth trip, even if I had long transits in Bangkok and Taipei, which allowed me to have additional trips. EVA Air is indeed a 5 star airline.

I flew ORD-IST-BOM and back. Checking in and Boarding at ORD was pleasant. The ORD-IST flight left on time and they offered Turkish Delight (sweet) on board with nice touches like hot towels for the face. Istanbul airport is the worst. The gate isn't announced until just 1 hour before departure and until then there is hardly any seating whatever there is it is for patrons of the overpriced restaurants. At the gate there was no boarding plan and no announcements! Just a hoard of passengers moving towards the gate in any random order. The most intriguing factor is their double standard- flights to/from the US serve Turkish Delights and hot towels have friendly staff who speak good English. On flights to India they don't serve any welcome sweet or hot towels and the staff are rude and can barely muster up basic English. On the return trip this double standard was confirmed. Also the flights to the US connect the airport with jetways where as Indian flights have to use a bus! Flights to the US require extra screening which again is done in a totally disorganized fashion and what's more our gate changed after the screening so we had to repeat the screening at the new gate! They ask weird questions going into much more detail than US immigration ever would and make you grossly uncomfortable. Our flight was delayed almost 2 hrs out of IST due to this gate change fiasco.,Passive
" Brisbane to Los Angeles. The Dreamliner and service by Qantas was a complete letdown. Firstly, Qantas didn't pre board families with children. Things went downhill from there. Even though we paid for seat selection, it was not honoured and we ended up with seats at the very back. Qantas have refused to refund as apparently these seats are in the same class as row 56 which we chose. I think not, who would choose the back row? The seats hardly reclined and were rock hard. The kids meals were inedible. Two of my 3 children are Autistic, and no help was offered, or given when my youngest child was sick. The constant flushing of toilets and loud conversations from cabin staff kept my children awake. This was a 14 hour nightmare journey. I would much prefer to fly on an A380 than this little plane. It may have pretty internal lighting and automatic shades on the windows, but this doesn't make up for the fact that space is tight and the seats are shocking. The better than you attitude of Qantas staff was just the icing on the cake. Never again.",Detractor
"  Overall this experience was comparable to flying a US carrier internationally. In other words, clearly inferior as an overall experience to something like SAS or Cathay but not nearly as bad as this site would have you think. The 787 from Warsaw to Chicago was reasonably comfortable for Economy, and of course, brand new. There was a decent selection of new and older films - not the most comprehensive I've ever seen, but you won't be bored, and the equipment was new and worked well. The aircraft staff were prompt and professional and service ran smoothly. Whoever was running the preflight desk in Warsaw definitely perfected a distant stare to avoid talking to anyone standing in line. The meal service food was just dreadful - in hour 8 of a 10 hour flight we were served an ice cold cheese sandwich after a truly gross lunch six hours earlier.

"This is the first and last time I would fly with Ryanair. We are a family of 4, I have a 9 year old daughter and 5 year old son. This airline expected my 5 year old to sit on his own at the front of the plane and my 9 year daughter to sit at the back. No one wanted to help or give me answer to the fact by law there not allowed to fly without a parent but yet you feel it's ok to separate my children from their mother. In the end a passenger actually moved so I could sit with my young children, if he hadn't my daughter would have been made to sit in the corner with 2 men who actually got really drunk and had to be spoken to on several occasions. I was told it's all to do with balance I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

"  Tokyo Narita to Dusseldorf via Madrid with Iberia. Probably the worst experience I've ever had when it comes to traveling by plane. Long before we were supposed to even fly, our seat reservation was constantly changed without any notice. When we wanted to check in online, our newly assigned seats were distributed all over. We finally got seats together for the first leg from NRT to MAD. However, the ground staff failed to assign seats next to each other from MAD-DUS. We were supposed to sit in Row 9 and 16 (fortunately we were able to change the seats in MAD). Departure was on time and shortly after we were airborne, lunch service had started. However, the service was very stressed and the cabin attendants did not seem to be very coordinated. The staff seemed more focused on getting everything done as fast as possible. During the coffee service, the flight attendant was literally running through the aisle, I could not even get my cup raised quickly enough to get some coffee. Upon request, the unfriendly cabin attendant grunted ""not now, maybe later"". Only after I asked another cabin attendant who was slightly more friendly I got my coffee which was cold by then. In general, the service was unfriendly. Adressing all passengers in Spanish, although it was very obvious, they were not speaking Spanish. They were also replying in Spanish, after I had adressed them in English. The food itself was awful. The noodles were overcooked and the meat was very chewy. Shortly after lunch service the cabin light was switched off and we were asked to close the window blinds leaving us in the dark on a daytime flight. After that, the crew completely disappeared and only appeared again for a quick snack service and the pre-arrival meal. As we were flying in one of their brand new A330-200 models from Tokyo, the inflight entertainment system was, hardware wise, state of the art. However, the movie and TV-series selection was rather poor. The 3D, interactive flight map, however was great. The connecting flight from Madrid to DÃ¼sseldorf held another unpleasant surprise. When we boarded the aircraft, the aircraft was extremely dirty. French Fries were all over the place and when I asked the flight attendant why it was so dirty, she replied ""there were kids sitting there and the company doesn't pay for cleaning until the airplane will be back in Madrid"".

We were seeking advise for our case allowance as we had to buy more clothes due to us not receiving our luggage, and we were told completely different things by two EasyJet colleagues. One told us that we could pay for the hand luggage and combine the weight (costing 7â‚¬) but the lady on the desk told us we would have to pay 45â‚¬.

I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that.,Passive

Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier. The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline.

I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.,Detractor

They have sent my bags to Heathrow even though I'm going to LAX. I expect them to know, check, or at least ask where I'm going. To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight.

Almost two hours into the flight we were finally served one meal and drinks. The flight was 6 hours 20 minutes and a night flight. When do you want us to sleep? And why on earth was there such a delay in the service? Then to be woken up 90 minutes before we land for just a coffee? Are you serious. Then to be told by the CSM that our luggage was still in London. Seriously? Well we know the luggage issue wasn't Qantas. Why do you feel the need to wake people for a coffee. On all other flights you fill out a card so as to not disturb the passengers who want to sleep. So glad I paid for a business class flight - not! Perhaps I should have gone economy.",Passive

Just a couple links that i am suppose to navigate on my phone in the middle of an airport. No flights out on any airlines till next day. I get a room and call Frontier. Almost an hr on the phone and they state that they will give me $400 and my ticket price which will basically pay for my airfare but i am stranded in Orlando for the night. The issue was a mechanical one and no fault of mine. I take care of my disabled husband. I not only missed a day of work but need to make arrangements for my husband and pay for a hotel. When talking to customer service they were rude interrupting and made no effort to try to rebook, no help with a hotel or any compassion at all. The ticket agents where just the same. Prices were not low enough to deal with the rudest, inconsiderate airline i have ever dealt with. I will not fly with them.. I will pay the extra for service and know i am protected.",Detractor
Flew from Sydney Australia to Vancouver on Air Canada and was truly a miserable experience. I'm a petite person and was miserably cramped in a small seat the food was disgusting and the most of the staff acted like those of us in economy class were an imposition. Two women who chatted loudly for 12 of the 14-hour predominately evening flight were not asked to lower their voices so that others could sleep the in-service entertainment a small screen inserted in the back of the seat ahead of us was dark and virtually impossible to see and although staff did pick up trash after meals they didn't after serving various beverages so we were left sitting in rubbish for the duration of the flight. Complaining seemed pointless in light of the persevering misery of the overall experience,Detractor
On 2 legs of a 4 leg trip the airline did not have enough food choices to accommodate business class passengers which is unacceptable. On one leg (Doha to London) several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class - these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. These passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. Overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. We would also comment that the boarding arrangements at Colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers - a total free for all. Finally on one leg (London to Doha) my wife's inflight entertainment had no sound.,Detractor
"Helsinki to Bangkok in Business Class. Boarding was made by bus so no priority for Business passengers - Shame. Very old plane (A340) with old seats and very ancient IFE! Screens did not work properly and the picture was with bad quality. Food on board was not very tasty but ok. They also forgot the printed menu lists on board so I could not choose what to eat really. I don't like their new menu because they try to serve you some ""fusion Asian"" with no Western options. Wines on board are still ok. The staff was mature like always on Finnair flights not very happy looking but still ok. Asian stewards were the best and most polite. I would still recommend them but I hope they get rid off that old plane.",Passive

"  I thought flying Cathay Pacific economy on an ultra long haul flight 3 weeks after returning from a similar distance in J would be a huge disappointment, but life (and CX) holds numerous surprises. Being a Marco Polo Club member allowed me to check in my entire family using the priority lanes on both outbound and return. The advantage was seen in the Manila to Hong Kong route where the check in queues at NAIA 3 seemed to snake around forever. Staff in MNL were courteous enough. Departing MNL through gate 111 was extremely chaotic. I would suggest that one hang around one of the pay-in lounges or in one of the (few) coffee shops outside the gate until the last minute. The MNL-HKG leg was the usual, rushed ultra short flight with absolutely no catering worth mentioning consisting of an overheated pastry, ANZAC cookie and boxed juice drink. PAL serves hot meals on their MNL-HKG flights even in economy, I wonder why a carrier such as CX still continues to think that this budget airline move is worthy of a 5-star airline? Same experience on the return HKG-MNL leg. The long haul product proved to be a pleasant surprise. The seats were more comfortable than expected and the 3-3-3 configuration does a lot for the perception of space in the back cabin. Catering is not CX's strong point, but the meals served were actually edible. The snack option of cup noodles were very tasty and the galley snack tray was always full. In-flight staff were pretty good with ready smiles and service. Good and frequent drink runs were made throughout the 16 hour journey both ways. I would say that it was a pleasant surprise through the long haul leg. I am on the fence regarding the IFE choices, but the hardware is pretty good if you bring your own earphones (the one provided by CX is rubbish). Touch screen was quite sensitive so there is little chance of bothering the passenger seated in front.",Passive

If you follow protocol and actually read the add on prices etc. you will get what you pay for. Budget airline that acts as a flying bus if you want anything more than this you should pay for a more expensive airline. It gets you to exactly where you need to go.

"Damman to Dubai in economy class with Saudi Arabian Airlines after connecting from KLM flight from Amsterdam. Transfer process at Damman virtually nonexistent and poorly organized, clearly not a common transfer point. No boarding announcement made, Sky Priority and elite status lane not properly enforced. However, boarding was quick and flight fairly empty. Crew managed a full hot meal service including metal cutlery on a 45 minute flight - an impressive feat, though a bit silly and impossible to properly enjoy. Crew were friendly and efficient, though not Saudi and few appeared to speak Arabic which may have been frustrating for many passengers on board. Aircraft a bit dated but clean, flight on time.

" We returned from Cape Town to Amsterdam via Johannesburg and Rome. The first sector was on SAA. Johannesburg is a tricky airport to transfer from domestic to international. Terminals are far apart and it requires re-check-in, security and passport control, then more long distance walking. Our 1H30 connecting time just got us as last passengers onto AZ's flight to Rome with minutes to spare. The club cabin on AZ's A330 is nice with incredibly comfortable, private and spacious seating. All window seats are singles, slightly staggered so some are closer to the windows then others, but all allow for good views from the windows. AZ's amenity kit is gorgeous. Proper printed menus for food and wine were handed out. Pre-departure bubbles, water and juice, international papers followed. Although AZ's pillow is of disposable quality the pillow case is beautiful and the blanket is fine too. AZ is obviously taking on-time performance seriously. All our flights left spot on time or early. Dinner started quickly after take off. Alitalia sets individual tables (no trays), this gives almost a First class feeling. Beautiful linens, glass and silverware. Dinner is a five course affair of solid quality. The pasta dish was gorgeous (and a full meal by itself). So far AZ's product is with the absolute top. The only aspect that could be better is the staff. They are so 'rough around the edges' and most interactions are 'rusty'. They are okay but not overly friendly or proactive. It seems they avoid interaction. What a pity because this created a rather 'frosty' atmosphere in the cabin. The purser did not make any effort to interact although she was constantly in the cabin with paperwork, dealing with her team as if we were not there. No welcome, 'how are you' or goodbye's from her. Sleeping on board is fine although the cabin was too hot, luckily window seats have individual vents. Seats in the middle don't so I would avoid those seats. Breakfast was rather 'Italian' with no options and sweets only. Also breakfast was served in total darkness, which I gather is not a problem for passengers (who have individual lights) but I guess not ideal for the staff. Arrival was on-time but Rome airport was it's usual mess. We enjoyed our Alitalia flight and recommend it.",Promoter
"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam.

" Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn't really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be â€˜fine I guess' but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual â€˜priority boarding' queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn't start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn't happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel. I used Avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money.",Passive
"Flew SIN - JNB on business, and in business class on SQ. Service to their usual high standard. Food out of SIN was very nice, food out of JNB was very average, but I assume that is dependant on what the local ground handlers can provide. Cabin clean enough and well maintained. SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection. This isn't really good enough these days and SQ need to upgrade their fleet in that respect PDQ!",Passive

The fare was low but with all the extra costs along the way (which is pretty much everything) we would have been better off buying a more expensive ticket on a better airline.

On the leg from Doha to Ho Chi Minh the seats were worse - again the staff were exceptional. The meals on both legs of the journey were catered for a certain pallet type which is expected but not helpful.

Just returned from USA. SYD-SFO-LV-NY-SFO-SYD. Overall very good experience - travelling with 3 others inc 2 Children. Upgraded both international legs to economy Plus - makes a world of difference.

Only gripe was that after a late Arrival NY-SFO it was announced that for those connecting to Sydney Australia that plane was being held (there were about 10 of us) and that we needed to proceed to International Gate 102. We all arrived there as quick as possible only to be told the plane was not going to wait and never was. The delay ex NY was not a UA issue - ground staff at Newark.

" Dallas to Oklahoma City. Normally I don't have problems with AA but after a recent flight cancellation for the second part of my journey, I am very disappointed with the lack of action on AA's part. My flight which was on a Sunday night was delayed for about 1.5-2 hours at which point it was canceled due to â€œmaintenance issues.â€ I called AA to reschedule a flight and also went to the customer service desk. I had a flight for work the following morning at 10:30 so I really need to get back. I asked if I could be put on another flight, switched airlines, flown out somewhere else and come from another place, get a rental car, or anything that would allow me to make my flight the next morning. They said there is nothing I can do but I can go online and get a reimbursement which should be up to $120. I ended up having to rent a car and drive from DFW to OKC which cost me about $260. I have tried to be reimbursed for this cost but the best I got was a $100 voucher that has to be used within a year. The problem is very few flights cost $100 so this forces me to fly AA again within the year and have to pay them more out of my pocket so this is in no way a reimbursement but a way for them to secure my future business. Additionally the refund for my flight was $79. I feel like I did everything I could possibly do on my part to remedy the situation and felt very helpless. I am very disappointed with AA's effort on this and I will likely turn to other airlines in the future. The next flight I could have flown on was at 4:50 the following night and AA never offered to put me in a hotel so I would have just had to stay in the airport or pay for a hotel anyways. AA created a situation where I was at their mercy for assistance and did nothing.",Detractor

Purser on board this flight was cold and barely answered when talked to (this is why I am rating cabin service poorly). The rest of the crew was OK. The airplane was one of the 737s that has not been yet revamped (N860AM). It was very uncomfortable and legroom was very tight.

They told us because it is a Q400 that they have to check in all the roller bags - this causes all sorts of delays upon arrival into Vancouver and is problematic if you have a connection due to a late inbound AC flight that delayed you to start with!

No drinks/snacks as people are boarding. A usual perk of 1st. Personal entertainment devices aren't always available. (Even when they say you have your own). There is no difference in extra leg room between 1st and economy plus. Just 2 seats a row instead of 3, which is nice, but not for the price difference. Service onboard is not first class quality when compared to Delta, Virgin, Air New Zealand (to name a few). Not even close. Food, drinks, services just not that special. Alaska sells off vacant 1st class seats at the last moment if they're available for $50. This is painful. Great for the person who gets a $1000 seat for $50 - not good when you pay a premium for peace and quiet. But, it explains why they don't care about good service in 1st. Alaska needs to step it up.

"  Ottawa to Fort Lauderdale via Toronto. This is my 2nd time flying Air Canada and my 2nd time experience subpar customer service. Air Canada employees seem to have little joy in working with the company shows their minimal interest in ensuring their passengers have comfortable flying experience. Upon check-in in Ottawa, I was given a boarding pass with no gate number. As someone who had a connecting flight, I had little time to waste to play a guessing game to figure out which direction to go to find the correct gate. I stopped to ask at one of the desk and got the gate information, but that cost me time that was unnecessary. At check-in , I wasn't asked about seating preference. When traveling with family members, without having to ask, we are usually seated in close proximity. I didn't realize, until I got to the gate that the Air Canada rep. had given me and my father (with whom I was traveling) seats that were far from each other. Both times I've traveled with Air Canada, I felt like someone who was given free passes to fly rather than a paying customer.",Passive

" Newark to Bangalore via Mumbai. Worst flight experience. I travelled with my husband. Flight from Newark airport to Mumbai airport, seats were not comfortable, the screen and the remote was defective. We were literally fighting with the screen to select the movie or pause or play it. The remote few buttons was missing for both of us. Food was not good and bread were hard and cold. The service was also not good. Our connecting flight is from Mumbai to Bangalore. We are still waiting at the airport which forced me to share this review at this moment itself. It seems our connecting flight didn't reach airport. After such a long journey it is tiresome to wait for the next flight without any estimation and food. Will try to avoid Air India flight by heart.",Detractor
" My wife and I flew SkyCouch Houston to Auckland on February 2 and Auckland to Houston Feb 23. It is worth the USD 600 paid to have an empty middle seat, but the three seats are near useless as a lie-down bed for a normal size adult. For two adults side-by-side, it's almost impossible. On two flights nobody on our plane tried to use SkyCouch as a bed. I suffer from chronic leg cramps and excruciating muscle spasms in my legs [if not stretched every hour or so]. Not to mention the possibility of pulmonary vein thrombosis in a 73-yr-old person such as myself. I did have one episode of a terrible muscle spasm, which necessitated me having to unbuckle my seat belt and stand up to put weight on my leg to relieve the spasm. Luckily, the flight was smooth at the time and no flight attendant had to order me to sit down [without regard to the severe pain that would cause me]. However, as I was stretching my leg and walking to a restroom, an attendant told me I needed to return to my seat when the captain activated the fasten seat belt sign. I'm a veteran traveler and know it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion with a flight attendant following airline rules and guidelines and will not or cannot make exceptions no matter how much pain and discomfort a passenger might endure. Nonetheless, I did take a moment to explain my difficult situation to the young stewardess, who probably could not imagine my 73-yr-old condition. Of course, she showed no sensitivity or understanding whatsoever, and told me - in a tone which indicated she thought I may have been senile - that I might bump my head in rough air if I were not seated and secured with a fastened seat belt. The fact that may have caused me excruciating pain did not register at all with her. She could have cared less. In such a situation the risk to my safety and good health was far worse if I were seated and buckled-in than if I were allowed to stand for a few minutes until the spasm passed and the pain lessened. I doubt that this review will result in a more tolerant and enlightened approach by ANZ [or any other alrilnes' flight attendants], but I hope this description of my situation on NZ28 [departure from AKL on Feb 23] might result in attendants having a more open-minded approach to dealing with a passenger's medical issue. But I sincerely doubt it. On a non-medical issue, how about ANZ joining the 21st century and providing satelite WiFi with Internet on the IAH-AKL route?",Passive

"This was one of Air France Boeing 777-2002 equipped with new business class seats in 1X2X1 configuration. My wife and I were in the middle (fifth) of the first cabin. These seats go full flat horizontal and I had never slept so well in a plane - although the Boeing 777 is not comfortable in my view, it is very sensitive to the turbulence). Cabin staff with a pleasant behavior (sometimes a little casual). Champagne (Brice) is not quite the best (in the JFK lounge there is a Mumm: is better). Using the IFE is unfortunately always as bad (not at all functional on the remote control). And the ratio between number of seats and toilets is not worthy of a great airline - only two to forty seats. In Qatar Airways we had a Bioeing 777 with four toilets (one for disabled) for six seats (1 for 4 instead of 1 for 20 on Air France).",Promoter
Just completed a return trip to Hong Kong on the A380 which is a magnificent aircraft. The crew food and inflight entertainment were good.

The business lounge is not what I would describe as a business class lounge as it is used by general public for a fee. The flight departed Sorong on schedule and arrived in Jakarta on schedule. The On board service was ok, however there was only two selections of food being served and none of these were western. I find this hard to comprehend as over 85% of the business class passengers on the flight were westerners.

I was not expecting much but I have to say that our recent flight from MAD to SCL in a A340-600 was really very comfortable. I believe we had the latest business class seat and the storage space around this is excellent - a lot better than BA business class. Staff were attentive and polite. I declined the late night meal as I wanted to sleep but breakfast was very good. The only downside was in the earlier connecting flight LHR-MAD with the usual business arrangement for European flights i.e. economy seat but 3 seats between 2 people. Flight was ok - the connection was well sign-posted as we had to change terminals but there was an exceedingly long wait on a bus for 25 mins and this limited the time we were able to spend in the lounge.,Promoter

Thai Smiles is not much of a smile! On domestic routes a large number of flights (but not all) are now done under the name Thai Smiles. If TG is an airline I have always appreciated and flown both internationally and domestically their Thai Smiles at least in Business class is just a way to cheat passengers: if you buy a ticket on TG you don't expect to be on a flight offering a low cost airline service at a normal airline business cost. On this flight Bangkok to Krabi we were sitting in coach seats (no passenger in the middle that is the only plus) food was revolting and service to its minimum. To be honest a few days later I flew another domestic TG from Chiang Mai to BKK this time with business seats and service. So be sure to check if your flight will be Smiles or not!,Detractor
"First and last time travelling with British Airways. The flight outw was reasonable, although they are sadly lacking in comparison to other airlines. My first question is does anybody from British Airways actually read these comments? If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in Toronto on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other bags. They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem - after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up on the Hotel Manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4 - not a problem normally. but it had cost Â£90.00 extra to book these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude.",Detractor

I had 5 flights covering a 3 week period and flew from Glasgow - Newark- Las Vegas - San Fran - San Diego back to Newark - Glasgow and was totally happy with the service provided to my family and I. We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them.

Lacking food options, only a couple of stale sandwiches and plain rice. The flight from Manila to Beijing on B737-800 was comfy enough - never tried the food as catching up on sleep. The changeover at Beijing was shocking - the queues and disorder unreal, no organisation, no Business class lanes and took over 1 hour 30 mins within the same Terminal. Then the hike to the Business Class lounge and what a waste of time that was. No cold drinks, poor Chinese food, very bland and my local budget take away does better and again, the smell of dust like the carpets haven't been cleaned since the Terminal opened. Final call for the last flight was 1 hour before the flight was due to depart, we were put on shuttle bus crammed like the local metros and waited over 30 mins before moving off to the plane and then of course delayed as per the Beijing usual. The seat on the B777-300 is a flat bed rougly 6'4"""" and slghlty narrow but comfortable, the AVOD is a waste of time unless you're Chinese. Food was shocking, all cold drinks served at room temperature - do they not have ice in China?",Detractor
  Amsterdam Schipol to Chicago O'Hare with United Airlines. The usual horrible service and unhelpful staff on this flight. Just asked for some headphones and was told they can't hand them out until we're in the air. When I asked why was told that it's for safety reasons. This despite everyone in the aircraft wearing headphones whilst I'm having this conversation. It's exhuasting having these nonsensical conversations with United staff. They can never give you a valid reason for any of their unhelpful behavior. It's like a game where they have to make the flight as miserable as possible for their passengers.,Detractor
LGA-YYZ-HND. I tried to reserve my seat on their online service in advance but what I saw was only their sorry page and I couldn't process any more for my seat request. When I checked-in at LGA they provided me another boarding pass for my connecting flight. I asked them to reserve a front side seat by aisle but they said they could not reserve any seats for my connecting flight at LGA. When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats. I have asked them to give me another seat but they answered they can't do that because the flight was full. I don't know why I couldn't request my seat in advance at LGA and transfer counter at YYZ.,Passive
" Travelled Kigali to Addis 8th June 2018 at 02 a.m. on a small B737-700. Upgraded successfully from economy class by putting my modest bid through their homepage. Check-in was very lengthy as they could not issue the second boarding pass when I was upgraded on the first sector. I could not accept it and stood at the counter almost Â½ hour before the second BP came out. Worth waiting for compared to waiting at a transfer counter in ADD to get it. It eventually went through and I then enjoyed the lounge access in KGL and good service on board in the four rows of business class (cabin Â½ full). I was disappointed they only served breakfast as I needed dinner. But I spotted from the menu card the dinner served on the incoming flight. I then managed to secure my favourite dinner from that menu, despite it was not on offer and a few hours old, but reheated. Pre-departure champagne brut (â€œLallierâ€) was fine. FAs attentive.

"  We flew Air Canada from Amsterdam AMS to Toronto YYZ having used British Airways to fly into Amsterdam. Initially we were concerned about the 1 hour 50 minutes connection time but this was not a problem as the Air Canada flight was delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes. Plenty of time for our baggage to make it from the incoming flight. Ground staff at AMS were useless, there were 5 of them behind the counter at the gate but only one appeared to be interested in serving passengers. Once on board, the aircraft itself was old and in serious need of TLC. The seat in front of me was split and the inner foam was bulging out. The in-flight entertainment was delivered on poor quality screens with an even poorer selection of out dated movies. The staff were pleasant enough and appeared to care about passenger needs. Upon arrival at Toronto, only 3 of our bags had made the trip with no explanation as to why one of them was still at AMS. We completed the form and were told that the bag would come on the next available flight on the following day. It didn't come, in fact it was finally reunited with us 9 days later and this was only after I had re-attended YYZ twice after being told that it was there when it wasn't. I have spent approximately 15 hours of our vacation on the phone to Air Canada's Indian call centre and yet the never made contact with me once. Avoid at all costs.",Detractor
Flew Business Class round-trip LAX -Stockholm Stockholm-SFO. I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.,Promoter

The Qantas club in Perth was nice with the usual inclusions service and food on the plane were great but the key down was the oldest seats I have been in since I was a teenager.

"All flights with TAP Portugal from Amsterdam to SÃ£o Paulo GRU via Lisbon were OK, left a bit behind schedule, but all arrived before schedule. Online check-in was good, but staff at baggage drop-off at Amsterdam could do better. The staff member was busier arguing with her colleagues about a problem with another passenger than labeling our bags. Aircrafts were OK, good seat space and overall clean. On the flight to GRU we sat in row 27 which is near the emergency exit. Leg space was ok, but sitting near the lavatories was in general not so nice. Food from AMS to LIS was a sandwich and some drinks. From LIS to GRU for dinner the only choice was chicken. For breakfast only cold, hard bread with some cheese and meat (no eggs whatsoever) IFE was enough choices to watch or listen. Staff only showed themselves during takeoff, landing and bringing food. The rest of the time they spend their time talking to each other. At other airlines at least the walk around the aisles offering water. Compared to other European airlines TAP on flights in Europe the are OK. Outside Europe they score below average considering services during the flight. I bought our ticket with a good promotional fare. If it would be the same fare as LH, Swiss, KLM of BA I don't think it's a good offer. In other words, TAP is quite basic.

" San Francisco to Dallas. Yesterday when I was checking in for my flight today, I decided to spring for the upgrade to the exit row. I was re-assigned seat 9D. I printed my boarding pass at home. At the gate, the agent took my boarding pass from me and handed me a different one. I didn't notice till I got on the plane that my seat had been switched to a non-exit row 7A. When I brought the discrepancy up to the flight attendant she said I had to go back to the gate agent to rectify the problem. It took a few minutes to swim upstream to get there and by that time the gate agent was coming down the gangway and he refused to help me and told me to take it up with customer service. When I went to the seat on my boarding pass 7A, there was a child sitting in the seat next to his mother who was in the middle seat. When I sat down in the aisle seat, the other passenger asked me to move to another row since there were other seats available. There were two open seats in Row 9 so I went to sit in one of those and the gate agent and flight attendant insisted I could not sit there even though I had paid for the exit row. The gate agent was incredibly nasty and threatened me that if I didn't go sit in the back of the plane he would throw me off the flight. At no time did they ask the woman who put her kid in my seat to either move or let me sit in the aisle seat. As I had an important meeting in Dallas, I did find an open seat in the back of the plane. The flight attendant was by this point thoroughly embarrassed and came back to apologize and brought me a glass of wine. She was great but I will never fly Virgin America again.",Detractor
I have been an airline passenger for the past 60 years. All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that!

HNL- YVC 15-12-14. We had been advised that our return flight was to be with AC Rouge. Having read a number of negative items concerning Rouge we were not expecting anything different. However we went with an open mind. The crew were professional and gave good service considering that it was a red eye flight. Departure and arrival were both timely. We sat in preferred seating which was much better than the regular economy seating. The seats were comfortable however did not recline too much. From a safety perspective I was unable to hear some of the announcements. There was no track lighting in the aisles. The overhead directional lighting did not work. Overall the aircraft 767-300 was clean. The toilets were cleaner than other AC flights that I have taken. The food for purchase was good however way overpriced. The funky uniforms of the flight attendants could be more professional. Ditch the hats. This is considered a no frills concept. They didn't miss the mark in that statement. The cost however is greater than mainline AC. I downloaded the AC Rouge APP and viewed some of the movies etc. They could do better as a lot of the downloads were old. For example I love Lucy Auntie Maime etc. Not worth purchasing the $10.00 iPad usage. Would I fly AC Rouge again? Firstly we fly every year to Hawaii. AC provided good service and we enjoyed those flights. We will no longer fly AC Rouge.,Detractor

"Flew return flights from Birmingham (UK) to Newark in December 2015 with United Airlines. Plane was 1 hour delayed leaving Birmingham due to issues with luggage being stored in the hold however no announcement was made by the crew until 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. The cabin crew on the way to Newark were rude and lacked basic customer service skills, even a smile and eye contact seemed to much. Rather than offer drinks, the trolley was swiftly marched down the aisle not stopping unless you caught their attention. My entertainment screen was also broken when I asked one of the female crew members to look if anything could be done I was told no and she wouldn't do anything. I understand it wasn't the end of the world as I had a book and my iPod but found her response unhelpful. Food was okay for airline standards and seats had a reasonable amount of legroom although we had upgraded to premium economy. On our return journey I was shocked at the rudeness of the staff at check in, we were using the self check-in system at Newark which I found clever and fast however the United Airlines attendant assisting passengers showed some of the poorest customer service I had ever seen, I'd advise not to ask for any help at this stage to anyone using the United Airlines Self Check in at Newark. The overnight flight back to Birmingham though was far more pleasant, it shows the difference a nice crew can make to your journey. Overall I wasn't massively impressed with United Airlines and probably would not use them again if it came to it.

The British Airways outbound flight from London to Hong Kong was on a 3 year old A380. We sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. On the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. The 5 year old Boeing 777 on the return leg was far more cramped. Also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to click on the screen. The crew on all flights were fine but nothing special.

Each leg was in Economy class on A320-200 aircraft. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service on all of the flights. All flights, even the short ones between Athens and Istanbul which were a little over one hour, included some sort of meal or snack service with drinks, food, and tea or coffee afterward. Although food portions were relatively small, everything tasted good. The flight crew were all polite and professional. Seats were comfortable for all flights and all planes seemed clean and well-maintained. Online checkin and baggage drop-off were straightforward and simple, and we were able to use family lanes in for baggage drop-off in Athens and Cyprus. There was no individual in-flight entertainment and we did not use Wi-Fi, but I enjoyed watching images from travel destinations in Crete and some of the Greek islands that were displayed on the overhead screens on final return flight from Athens and Paris. The rest of the time, reading and video games on our own devices during flights were fine for entertainment given that all of the flights were under 3 hours.

Back in Montreal we encountered nothing but rude and useless staff. I had to pay for a cab and Air Canada only offered a voucher for 10 dollars. Next day the same aircraft was used to resume the trip. The returning flight Geneva-Montreal was also cancelled due to mechanical issues and it was the same aircraft. I lost it at the airport when the useless staff just give me a new flight for next day without even try to look for an alternative flight (several flights going to Paris for instance).

After waiting an hour on the runway we were unable to take off due to a storm that was off in the distance (not a big deal if they were on time however it was their fault for being late and getting caught in the storm).

"I was flying recently from Lincoln NE to Chicago IL. This flight goes back and forth between the two cities multiple times per day. The Lincoln airport also houses Delta and only has four gates so it is very small. The first flight left Lincoln and made it to Chicago with no problems. As the flight was coming back to Lincoln from Chicago it was diverted to Kansas City MO in which the staff members told us that it is too ""foggy"" to land in Lincoln. What was upsetting was that our flight was delayed three hours and there was not any fog in the area. In fact there was partial sunshine the day of our flight. The staff did not even apologize or attempt to assist the customers who had connecting flights in Chicago. Once on the aircraft the flight attendant was very rude and demeaning.

LHR-ORD-LHR. Initial impressions of United were not great as I attempted to check in online only to find that their website system 'could not check you in at this time' after going through the whole process! United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient. I will try to avoid flying with United again until they improve the quality of their product.,Detractor
" I've flown Delta's new A350 at least 8 times in the past year on transatlantic and transpacific routes from Detroit to China and Europe. I am not impressed with Delta's new flagship. In economy class, the aisles are very narrow and you are constantly getting bumped by flight attendants and passengers if you're in the aisle seat. Seats themselves are narrower than on other Delta aircraft, although legroom is adequate. The number of bathrooms in economy is seriously inadequate. Most disturbing, though, is the quality of the interior. It is very evident that costs were cut, as things are breaking down quickly. On this current flight, the window shade was stuck in the closed position as it looked like it was off-track. On another flight, it was a broken lavatory door. On a third flight, the lavatory light didn't work so you had to use the facility in total darkness. And most annoying, the entertainment system didn't work on yet another flight so all passengers were out of luck, no compensation was offered. I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member and at the point where I'm purposely seeking out either A330 or 777 aircraft on my frequent trips to Europe where possible. Those older aircraft are more spacious and comfortable, and their interior fittings much more durable and reliable. It will be a sad day when the A350 replaces these other aircraft unless Delta does something to improve it.",Passive
Flight F9 1256 4/15/15. I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus. Expect to get from point A to point B nothing more. Plan on bringing a pillow and a book to make the flight more comfortable.,Promoter

When we arrived at the ticket counter at the airport in Albuquerque, we found out that it didn't open until an hour or so later. Surprisingly, two Alaska Airlines employees came out and helped us with our luggage tags since they use a special holder to attach to the luggage. As we were about to start boarding another employee approached us and asked if we would like to board using a new system that they were starting to use.

"We flew on 4 long-haul legs in June and July business class. Service was friendly and efficient throughout. The meals were well-considered: light dishes were available for every meal plenty to eat and drink. The seats however were not to our satisfaction. There's heaps of room but the back of the seat is straight and the headrest pushes your head forward. The recline angle is small and the adjustable footrest is useless. There is a footstool but I am 173cm tall (5' 8"") and it was too far away for me to use comfortably. So I spent much of the time trying to find a comfortable sitting position. The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports. I hope they don't use United again because their lounge in Melbourne hasn't been updated since discos were fashionable. (SIA's lounge in MEL was being renovated).",Passive
London Gatwick - Trondheim. Completely ridiculous check-in system. You can't check-in online but at the airport you have to do it in a self-service machine. You then attach your luggage label to your bag. Then you stand in line for an hour to drop your bag off. What is the point? Stockholm - LGW no online check-in. Self-service check-in didn't work. But there were three people on the desks and the whole process was extremely quick and easy. B737-300 was extremely cramped even though the flight wasn't full. Sort out the check-in at Gatwick and I will happily fly Norwegian again. Good destinations and good prices.,Passive

On 24/7/2014 I travelled Business Class from Melbourne to London Heathrow via Doha. The first leg of the journey on QR905 was relatively OK but on arriving at Doha with a 2 hour wait for my next flight I went to the business class lounge where I was abruptly turned away as apparently there was no room left. I was left unable to shower or purchase any refreshment and had no option but to wait at the gate for my flight. The flight was delayed due to waiting for other passengers which resulted in a very unpleasant time sat on the aircraft. The service on board was OK but the toilets were not cleaned. My monitor kept sticking and despite being reset would not function properly. I feel very aggrieved that I paid for a business class flight and received economy treatment - I have yet to receive a response to my email from Qatar Airways.,Detractor
Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers. Cabin crew's apologies were sincere and they did their best to make it up for me.,Passive

"  The worst customer service from American Airlines flying from New Orleans to Dallas. These people have no respect for the passengers. There is no one to talk to. They checked in my husband's and my carry-on bags at the gate due to the limited space in the cabin (even though each of us had one personal item and small carry on) they promised that they would return us the baggage in Dallas as we had to stay over night because of the connection. We arrived but the baggage wasn't there. They sent us from Terminsl C to Terminal D to receive the baggage. Arriving at the baggage claim area, there was a staff member who wasn't willing to help at all. He was calling some customer service counter where nobody was available pretending that he was doing something. As I was furious, we asked for a supervisor, then he called someone else, again we had to repeat the story. Anyway, after 4 hours of waiting in the airport we received our bag and could finally leave to the hotel to get some rest. In the morning, went back to the airport for the next flight, asked for a supervisor. The lady wasn't even willing to talk to us. She was looking around as we were complaining and stopped us saying you only talk about ""negatives"" I can't do anything about it. There was 3 other people with different problems over there.

If you decide to check in in a time frame that Vueling considers too late (2 days before!) then you will only be able to do it at the airport as the app will not assign you any random seat but you will be forced to pay for seat assignment. How mean and stupid is that? Their seat space is the worst, even in their so-called emergency exits (15 Euros for the privilege of sitting on one of them!). Attendants are stressed, refreshments expensive (10 Euros for a sandwich and a coke) and they normally have run out of half of what is listed in the menu. TheyÂ´re not that cheap either.

"This review is to prepare other Frontier ""possible"" passengers of the potential additional costs of flights. Due to a family emergency, I quickly found a flight to be with an ill family member. The most direct flight at a reasonable cost was selected - It just happened to be Frontier. The cost was slightly less expensive than other carriers. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, I was impressed and even purchased the ""DEN Discount"" for $49. That was then. Today, I see there's a $30 fee to Carry-on my luggage. (Yes, I said carry my own) baggage. Then there's the $6-25 fee for your seat. That's an extra - $82 costs! After I realized, I was more cost effective using another carrier and that I would never fly Frontier again. I asked to be refunded for the DEN Discount. Sorry the rep said after 24 hours it's non-refundable. My flight isn't even scheduled until tomorrow. After looking at these reviews - I'm regretting my choice to go Frontier!

About one third of the passengers bumped off the flight, then the rest of us received no baggage at Gatwick. A reason of ""high winds"" was given, yet all other airlines appeared to be leaving Florence without any problems. Zero response from Vueling on whereabouts of the luggage so far.

Sat in extra legroom seats where I suspect that many others had not paid but checked in without seats and were given the premium seats since that''s all that was available. On the return though I checked in online I was sent back to the ticket counter since an online boarding pass must still be stamped.

Flew Sydney - Beijing - London. Both planes were old tatty and cleanliness left a lot to be desired especially the toilets. Both flights were delayed. For the second flight the scheduled time of the flight from Beijing to London was changed at the last minute. No delay was mentioned anywhere in the airport. Nothing was communicated by the airline the time just mysteriously changed from 14.30 to 16.10. When the staff were asked about it they either pretended to not speak English or just didn't. No apology was issued on the flight. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the flight was due to take off so no excuses there. We already had an 8 hour stopover so the extra couple of hours wasn't welcome when our total journey time was already 30+ hours. The entertainment system didn't work at all on my seat - not good for an 11 hour flight. Didn't matter as I had my iPhone loaded up with videos / music except Air China won't let you use your phone on the flight even with flight mode switched on!

"Heathrow Bag drop with no queue and friendly staff. Boarded the aircraft and left on schedule. I found the leg room and width fine for my 6'1"" frame. Not over spacious but comfortable for a 3 hour flight. Aircraft was clean and seemed pretty new. Certainly a step up from the rather tired 777 and 747s BA uses on long haul routes. A bit of food and drink served by friendly staff helped pass the time until our on time arrival. Efficient, punctual and comfortable. Return flight was equally smooth.

Heathrow - Lusaka Via Addis Ababa Economy. It was the only flight I could get to and from Lusaka. I wasn't expecting much but they're not as bad as they seem not bad but not great. Flight from Heathrow boarded on time I struggled to find my seat as the seat numbers on the luggage compartments were unreadable as they were so worn down. Upon finding my seat there was somebody sat there kindly asked them to move which they did. Left 10 mins late but arrived at Addis early. The cabin crew on our flight to Addis were very ignorant all the flight attendant calls were ignored however they did leave drinks out in the galley and I was told to 'serve myself whatever I wanted'. The Toilet was filthy wet and covered in tissue same went for the other toilets windows very dirty and greasy. Addis airport is terrible no signs or information except 3 flight information screens. Three toilets for the whole terminal long queues. The queue for security before boarding your flight was long and unbelievably slow. Shops are ridiculously expensive as normal. The flight to Lusaka was brilliant the crew were much more attentive food on both flights was very tasty (beef curry with rice). Both flights were on the new 787's. Both seats on both flights were hard and uncomfortable quite narrow. Inflight entertainment on both flights was somewhat acceptable. Aircraft was very clean. Lusaka to Addis was on an old 767 which on the exterior showed its age. The interior was clean and tidy however lacked inflight entertainment. Service was good as was the food fish curry and rice. Addis to Heathrow on the new 777 flight left at 1am boarding was chaos annoyingly we were served a meal at 2am chicken curry and rice which was tasty but didn't go down well.

It would have been nice to have an individual TV but not a big deal each seat had a radio with a few music channels and a movie was on the overhead screens.

In the morning they offered a turkey and cheese croissant sandwich and muffin hot and cold beverages. People complain about airline food but I found it to be wonderful. The cabin crew took good care of you. I got up like 3 times to ask for more water and it was given to me with no issues. People classify Air Europa as a budget airline but I was very happy.

"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not LufthansaÂ´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew.

Flight from London to Bangkok was OK (just) but the flight back was an awful experience. We were in the middle of 4 seats and both middle seats have a metal box on the seat in front just where one leg needs to go so you end up with one leg at an angle all the time and one foot twisted. Not at all comfortable on a long flight. Seats were hard. On the way out they gave us a menu which listed cocktails liqueurs etc but we were not offered anything other than wine and only 1 glass at that. Food was not very good. Flight back to London from Bangkok was terrible. We had the same middle seats so same problem with where to put your feet. The staff were extremely unfriendly - not one smile from any of them until the point at which we all left the plane. When we asked for a gin and tonic we were treated to glares and when we (plus a number of other passengers) asked for a second glass of wine with the meal it was almost thrown at us.

My experience with Eurowings improved much, as previously (on flights DUS-WAW-DUS) I didn't enjoy it due to cramped space in Dash Q400 and poor service. But on this particular rotation it was way better. CGN-HAM on brand new A319 with nice interior and comfy seats. Cabin crew very nice, but the service itself was like a pure low-cost. However, the flight was very short (just 45 minutes) so could not complain much. Return hop operated by Adria Airways - delayed by 45 minutes. Interior nice, overhead screen with live flight tracking, cabin crew served tasty snacks and soft drinks free of charge. Staff nice and smiling. Overall, the option for travelling from Cologne to Hamburg was great, as flights were considerably cheaper than train rides.",Passive
"Travelled from London to Chicago on the morning of 17th August (UA928) with my recently widowed daughter, and her 7 month old baby, to visit another daughter. The staff on board were excellent and very helpful, but just after I left the plane we discovered I had left our jackets on the plane. A member of staff said go back in and get them, but I was met at the door by the rudest person, ""don't put one foot in here"" she said - so, so rude, I think she was the head hostess. I find people are nice or they are not, there was no need for such rudeness.",Promoter
"  Toronto to London in premium economy. Easy check in and fast track security meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Unfortunately, they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight. Poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it's last legs. I let the front desk know, and the staff made me a fresh sandwich. Also, beers had changed with 5 lagers and Newcastle Brown. The Manager fetched some IPA from the first lounge - some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge. The most disorganised boarding ever with few PAs. Onboard, juice or water offered. I asked for sparking wine but it's only done on flights from London - (crew explained it can't be chilled at outstations - (poor excuse given they do it for Club and First). Fast service after take off with an ok entree. Poor salad, and a nasty dry piece of cake. IFE was the same as my trip over Christmas so it seems the IFE is updated less often. Tea, coffee and juice offered before landing. But no muffin or even a biscuit - really poor. Prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt. Return a week later was a better flight. Easy check in again and no fast track queue. North Lounge was an average experience, ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh. Bused to aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, with premium economy only half full. A half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten. Fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service. An ok meal with a rancid coleslaw, ok steak and a tiny pot of desert. Generous with the drinks. Unfortunately, the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by BA. I was offered T&Cs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger. The crew were genuinely embarrassed (a couple of sandwiches I liberated from the club lounge made up for it). Fast off the plane, and despite slow immigration, the bags beat me again. Overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors. The meal is nowhere near Club standard and its the cutting of the small things - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most. Be competitive but don't take it out on me! I wouldn't mind but the prices don't go down with the reduction of service. Despite what the CEO maintains - it is not in response to customer feedback. BA need to listen to what we're saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as bad as the budget airlines. Eventually the hardiest of us loyal BA customers will give up and move airline / alliance and that would be a shame.",Passive
" Early flight from Athens to Rome on Ryanair, departing at 06:55. Baggage drop off went ok. Going through security was fine as well. Boarding at Athens was on time as well as departure. There was commotion at the gate, as two more Ryanair flights to Rhodes and Paphos were departing almost at the same time and there was not enough seating. Boarded the plane by taking a bus and then going up the stairs - not very pleasant if you have a carry on!. Staff on board were pleasant, and tried to sell their on-board products.

Warsaw-Helsinki-Bangkok. Flights on time good connection in Helsinki. Warsaw to Helsinki was an Embraer 190 and Business Class is a bit cramped and has only standard seats without additional leg room. Good friendly service from cabin staff. Enjoyable food and wine. Helsinki to Bangkok I liked the flat bed which made a good sleep possible. Dinner served quickly and efficiently after take off making it possible to get a good sleep.

"We recently had our first experience flying Air Canada Rouge. It shall be our last. First, our booking showed a Lufthansa flight number for our Ottawa to Barcelona flight via Montreal. We never thought we had been switched to Air Canada Rouge and did not discover this until check in. Imagine our surprise when we ended up on an old AC plane with no entertainment system, no air circulation system and, of course, no leg room. The Rouge service entertainment system app was not working at all so our in-flight entertainment was watching passengers with regulation-size carry on luggage try to fit their cases into overhead bins that were too small to hold anything other than a knapsack. We have flown discount airlines before, on short haul flights (2-3 hours) within North America and Europe but on those occasions we did intentionally book those flights. So why were we put on a Rouge flight when our tickets showed a Lufthansa flight number? Air Canada, you deceived us. We shall remember that.",Detractor

I am a Qantas Platinum but decided to try something different. Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing! Lack of storage in seat area. Would I fly Air NZ again? Only if the price was right.,Passive

Seats were comfortable enough, seatpitch ok, IFE was of good standard (not up there with SQ's latest offering, but also a lot more stable), food was ok, overall nothing extraordinary but also nothing to complain about. What made these flight stand out from the connecting flights on SQ was the crew. Whereas SQ's delivered a perfect product, LX's crew may not have been quite so efficient - but they added a personal touch even in the economy cabin. I felt like a guest, someone to be welcomed on board, a person in the same right as the crew. I was not the customer to be satisfied. I was a person to interact with. Yes, the grooming of SQ's FAs was spotless. But LX's FAs were certainly a lot more likeable. When I said goodbye to one particularly nice member of cabin crew she obviously meant it when she said she'd like to welcome me again soon.

"Bangkok to Sydney. Have previously flown this leg 6 times with a well-known Thai based airline. As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not. However I think that does not make up for the uncomfortable seating and unfriendly service.",Passive

CAI-BAH-DXB in Y class. Check in at CAI was smooth. Cabin crew seemed generic and left no impression despite a relatively light load. A340 is by now unbearable and I do recommend against flying GF on their A340s. Wonky IFE bad seats shabby interior make for a really bad experience. Catering was quite poor - the main was alright but salad/desert were terrible. No bread or butter to be seen. Cabin did not give each passengers their own soda can which I find disappointing considering the amount of money a ticket costs. Transfer in BAH was smooth and efficient and I would rate the transfer experience ahead of DXB AUH and even DOH. More seating space in BAH than there was a few years ago. Second leg was an A330-200 better interior snack box more worthwhile and friendlier crew. GF really does need to re-motivate its employees and get rid of those A340s.

Priority boarding honoured on both flights. Seat was comfortable and there was a reasonable amount of legroom and recline. On-board catering was pretty good.

"If you investigate Rouge in advance, and consider this to be Air Canada's vacation tier product, I think you will be fine with the level of service and comfort. I have seen complaints about the premium economy seats on these flights - these are definitely not to be compared to business class. They are larger but still economy style seats (no lie flat, no pods etc.) I have status with Air Canada (which did not do much for me on this flight except for a faster luggage drop off.) I was flying with 2 other couples and a 1 year child, for whom a seat was purchased. Seat comfort: I upgraded to a seat with more legroom (Rouge Plus - not Premium Economy, just a seat with more legroom in economy). There was sufficient legroom for the flight - better than the Air Canada Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 seating which I will not take again unless forced to. I would not fly to Europe in a Rouge regular economy seat as these are very tight. A pillow and blanket were supplied as part of the seating without extra charge. I was comfortable enough to sleep. Meals: Dinner (Chicken, quinoa salad, one roll, some kind of dessert) or pasta (did not select) is included on the flight to Lisbon outbound from Toronto as well as a slice of banana bread about 1 hour before arrival. Two or three drink services (two on the overnight flight and three during the day). Meals are included on transatlantic flights - you must pay for alcohol and only credit cards are acceptable. Quality was comparable to Air Canada Economy class, which is to say, barely acceptable, but edible and hot. Meal on return was chicken or pasta - quality of meal was better. Snack provided was a hot chicken or vegetarian wrap. Edible. (Flew Rouge from Toronto to Las Vegas and on these flights you have to pay for food). Flight crew: Young, but very helpful especially with the baby and the car seat. Checked twice to see that the seat was approved (which is important to everyone). Service was decent. Communication: Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hours due to someone deploying an emergency chute while the plane was on the ground. Communication wasn't great but I did find out the reason by speaking nicely to a person on the desk. Announcements were made twice that we had a $10 credit to spend in the terminal on food. Not a lot, but at least we only had to show our boarding pass to get the credit, so did not have to line up for a voucher. Inflight entertainment: Runs on iPad (your own or one you can rent for $10) or some Android devices. Had no problems with Android on this trip (did have on a previous trip, so they may have fixed this). One plane had universal plug/usb outlets for charging, but one did not, so I wouldn't count on this. A reasonable selection of movies for a 7 hour flight. We all arrived safely, our luggage arrived as well, there was enough on board storage for carry on luggage now that Air Canada is enforcing the size restrictions on carry on luggage (something I approve of) and it all was relatively uneventful. Overall I would fly Rouge again but only in a Rouge Plus seat. It is convenient not to have to transfer in say Frankfurt to get to less travelled destinations in Europe like Lisbon. I like the non stop flights that are offered by Rouge. You need to understand however that this is not the top tier product and you are paying for a lesser product but not having to stop anywhere.",Passive

On 8th March I flew Virgin America in economy from SFO to LAS for $49.00 return. Was looking forward to the flight and it proved to be a positive experience. I was a bit put off by the loud rock music blaring by the check-in kiosk and a rather indifferent ground attendant herding people to and from the check-in area. I feel that airports are confusing and loud enough without the added distraction of loud music. I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived. The seats in First are very comfortable and pre-take off drinks were served by a very pleasant stewardess.

LON-HEL-SVX. Flew Finnair a couple of years ago on the same route and I am sorry to say that the quality has dropped even further. No inflight entertainment or anything to help keep the kids occupied. I asked if they had any children activities and was told they didn't do it anymore. The quality of the food is poor for the price I paid I don't think a cold chicken curry sandwich is acceptable. You can of course get nicer food but you have to pay for it. Inflight service on the Helsinki legs was inadequate. I needed to get some water for my boys and my call light was ignored when I finally asked I was told to wait until the trolley came through. The plane only had 2 toilets and when my oldest boy needed the toilet there was a long queue my wife asked to use the business class toilet and after several curt refusals he allowed to use the toilet. There was a general feeling of a lack of care from the IFA's on the flights as if we were annoying them by being on the plane. Service on the Helsinki - Ekaterinburg legs was better but no more than adequate and nowhere near the high standards I was expecting. Finnair is taking on a lot of elements of budget airlines in its ethos and this is starting to filter through with poor in flight service and really poor food.,Passive

"Last October I flew from Amsterdam to Jakarta through Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were pretty much all very short almost 'bitchy' and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. Between Dubai and Jakarta they use a Boeing 777. Another disappointment! The plane on the inside was old seats smelled and looked like they definitely could use new fabrics. The entertainment screen was small and old (my 3 year old tablet has a better screen than that onboard the 777 of Emirates) supposedly touch screen it worked horribly even with the remote control device. Different plane and different crew but not a different mentality of the crew. From Jakarta to Dubai we flew again with the 777. Same complaints as on the way to Jakarta and on top of that when we arrived 5am in Dubai we had to get out of the plane far from the terminal building. We had to use stairs to get out and clearly the stairs weren't designed to handle such a large plane since there was quite the difference in height between the stairs and the exit door of the plane. When I asked the crew why we didn't taxi to the terminal the reply was ""there is no available gate"". This is the home base of Emirates and there is no place for its own planes? From the runway we had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal which took about 20 to 30 minutes. From there it was very confusing where to go once inside the terminal building. For my girlfriend and I this was the first and last time we used Emirates.",Passive

Hong Kong to Beijing. Wanted to fly Hong Kong to Toronto direct but booked flights with points and this routing was the only one available. Aircraft was an old and tired Boeing 777. A bit dirty around the seat area. We flew business and my foot rest was broken and could not be adjusted by the power button. When the seat in front was in the full recline position it encroached onto my space quite a bit. Flight was set for 2.20pm and it left on time and arrived in Beijing 15 minutes early good for me as I had a rather tight connection. The snack was a salad and fried rice. Food was just barely adequate which I didn't finish. Flight attendants spoke some English enough to get by. Would not choose this airline unless I have no choice.,Passive
We chose bulkhead seats in Saga class not knowing there were no foot rests. Since I have serious leg problems I need to have my legs raised somewhat during most of the flight. There was nothing to put my feet on. The staff were excellent allowing me to use my carry on for support but this was not adequate. I had trouble walking the entire visit to the UK. I am dreading the flight home. We had to wait in Toronto and Iceland plane was late leaving no place to sit in Iceland airport so had to stand for 30 minutes. No boarding preference were discouraged from using the lounge because of distance to walk from gate. No indication on ticket or booking regarding dinner service. The only difference from economy was the wider seat. I will have to fly home but never again.,Passive
"  Chicago to Granada via Madrid return. Traveling with Iberia was a huge hassle. Our flight home was delayed five hours and we had to run back and forth between American Airlines and Iberia to book a new flight. Also we were all given the same ticket to exchange at the Iberia desk for boarding passes. The attendant honored three tickets of the four of us, but made the last member of our party return to American Airlines. In the end we had to be escorted by an American Airlines attendant so he could discuss the issue for use. There was nothing wrong with the ticket and the attendant honored the ticket only when told to do so by another worker. Went we changed flights my vegetarian order was lost and I was given a meat meal which I could not eat. The flight attendants were never available so I could not flag one down to request a meal. Overall Iberia seems to be an incompetent airline who is extremely slow and often unwilling to help it's customers. Will not fly with them again if I can avoid it.",Detractor
"  About 1 week to departure we got a wonderful email informing us our return flight went from a hour and a half layover to a 8 hour layover. When we called to ask why it was changed they could give us no answers and just gave us a 50$ voucher. So, you're going to give me a 50$ voucher for an 8 hour layover which I'd now need to get a hotel since we took red eyes in hopes of saving money. So now I was down 100$ for a hotel nearby without getting a taxi. That's just where it began to be fun. Our first flight was flying from PHX to DEN, take in mind we paid for better seating and upgraded our seats for more leg room. Upon entering the plane all of the seats were the same size and it was uncomfortably cramped (Arm rests didn't move). When I asked the flight attendant why our upgraded seats were not upgraded I was told that is because the plane ""we chose"" didn't offer it and then ignored me completely for the rest of the flight not offering me anything when walking by even while I continuously said mam. So we had a layover in DEN for an hour and a half, by the time I got on the next plane I was already a little upset with my service. So, next plane comes and we board. The seats were slightly larger towards the front but none of the arm rests went up. Who thought that was a good idea? Let's give economy moveable arm rests but upgraded seating to slightly larger, more cramped seating? During this flight I asked why the arm rests didn't go up and was completely ignored, so I dropped it, I then asked for a drink yet again on this flight. Three times I asked, the lady continued to stare at me while I stared back until 3 and a half hours went by and she had the courage to ask me ""Would you like a soda?"" at this point I was annoyed and responded by ""yes, I asked 3 times"" and she just responded with ""No need to yell sir"". Then asked me again ""So you're sure you'd like a drink?"". I was just shocked, we were landing in 15 minutes and I just decided to move on and forget it. So our returning flights a week later went exactly how I suspected. It was ORL to DEN then to PHX. On our way to DEN we were consistently bugged by our flight attendant to move for this couple that had ""air sickness"" after waiting over 30 minutes for them to stop essentially blackmailing me I said alright move. So I moved to a non-premium seat so this couple could sit in our seats. The flight went on and they proceeded to watch movies, laugh and disturb everyone around them. Seems our seats cured their ""air sickness"". Not to mention I barely fit in their seats (6""10, 350 lbs). On our last flight to PHX I finally caught a break with the terrible service and finally got a beverage and some answers to why our flights had been so poor. They told me it was because they were receiving new planes. Then continued to talk about their credit card for the next 45 minutes of the flight while handing brochures to everyone including me which I made clear I did not want and never will want. So when I got back home I decided to call Frontier up because I was absolutely shocked by their service. I was told to calm down and that I needed proof and that all of their planes had premium seating and lifting arm rests and was completely disrespected and was told deal with it or pay the difference, 900$ more.",Detractor

23/1/15 BKK-BAH-JED GF153. Flight couldn't take off due to technical problems ground staff were totally overloaded with handling this situation.

After waiting 2 hrs on the runway and another 4 hrs in the gate at the airport finally we were brought to a hotel. Sleeping time only 5 hrs to go back to airport where the plane was ready to fly to BAH. No information for passengers how to claim for the delay was presented at the check in counter not mentioned by the staff. Finally we arrived 16 hrs later in BAH.

" Worst airline experience ever. Flying from Cozumel thru Atlanta on 4/15/18. Our connecting flight in ATL was delayed due to a scheduling error by the airline. Once that was resolved we got on the plane, but were again delayed. We sat on the tarmac for 2 hrs before the plane returned to the gate due to a mechanical error. By now it was nearly midnight. Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 9:15 pm. We were then told no flight was available til 7:00 am the next day and we'd be given hotel vouchers, but would need to be back at the airport by 5:00 am. The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude. I will never fly this airline again.",Detractor

" My flight to Bangkok did not start well. Ground staff were rather unfriendly, but what followed was simply unbelievable. After we boarded the plane and were moving towards runway, the pilot announced there was some technical fault with the plane and we have to go back. Well, we did the same 3 times and the plane spent 6 hours at Heathrow sitting on tarmac with all passengers on board. During these 6 hours we were not allowed to go back into the terminal and were only given water whilst business class passengers were offered food. The airline blamed Heathrow, but should have managed situation better. After 6 hours we finally took off to Helsinki. I missed my connecting flight and had to be rerouted. The were no more seats to Bangkok for days. They put me on a flight to Singapore and from there to Bangkok with Singapore Airlines. The whole trip was over 30 hours instead of 16 on the ticket. They also put my luggage on a different flight, but delivered it later to my hotel. As you can imagine, I did not enjoy this flight, but I'm not really blaming the airline cos I'm sure situations like this one are highly unusual. Flights overall are comfortable, good inflight entertainment, good food, but I was absolutely exhausted after 30 hours of flights and awful 6 hour delay. Nevertheless, I still recommend the airline.",Passive
Somebody needs to place a warning about SAAs practice to overbook flights. In my case we are a family of 4 and on a flight from Johannesburg to Windhoek we were held by staff at the check-in counter for 45 minutes to ensure that we could not reach the gate in time. Only when the gate was closed we got our boarding pass. Only after many hours of discussion with the transfer desk and the supervisor on duty we got the hotel voucher and a flight the following day. At the hotel we encountered many fellow passengers who were bumped from their flights to London and Frankfurt including families with small children.,Promoter

No issues at all at the airport or on the plane. I do have to say you get what you pay for in some aspects though.

"  Bombay to Tokyo Narita in Business Class on a Boeing 787-8. Boarding in Bombay was very orderly. The Business Class pods on ANA are very well conceived, affording privacy, comfort and plenty of table space. In-flight service is excellent, with flight attendants displaying warmth and efficiency. One point of criticism: we didn't see any food until 90 mins out of Bombay and the hot course arrived only after 2 hours. Given that the flight departs BOM at dinnertime, this is unacceptable. ANA should roll out the dinner service soon after attaining cruise altitude. There as no wifi on this flight, another sore point with me. But the overall experience is first rate.",Promoter

Personally addressed in C only on the DXB-MUC leg but also forgot after dinner to serve coffee or tea and the chocolate to me and my wife. In MUC they had troubles fixing the airbridge at the upper deck which resulted in late disembarking of all C and F-Class pax so at the passport control all Y-Pax (almost 300-400) were in front while the priority baggage was already on the bag carousel.

We flew from Frankfurt to Calgary and 3 weeks later again from Vancouver to London. Our first trip was a bit hectic because we had very little time to catch our connecting flight. We had to run to our gate and once arrived there was a big queue. We were assigned 2 seats apart from each other (15 rows in between) so despite the big queue we went to the Air Canada desk at the gate to ask if it was possible to change our seats. The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled. The inflight entertainment system however was even better (latest version) so no complaints about that at all. Overall impression of flying with Air Canada was good.

"I have just flown my outward leg of a short break to Hong Kong and have mixed feelings about the journey. I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380. However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet. The best thing about the whole flight is that I only paid Â£340 including credit card charge booking fees so happy that I am now in Hong Kong and enjoying my break.",Passive

September 30 2014 I flew home to Canada from Athens. It was an 11-hour flight and it was the worst flight I have flown. I did not know about Rouge. My flights were booked by an agent and I was not warned about the details of this economy-class flight. I did not know that there was no on-board entertainment and that I would have to rent an I-pad or that the seats were cramped and that I would have to pay for any alcoholic beverages. I am used to flying transatlantic on a regular Air Canada flight to Heathrow or to Frankfurt and those flights have been comfortable and enjoyable. This flight from Athens was a nightmare crowded with uncooperative passengers who insisted on standing in the aisles visiting with their friends and refusing to sit down when asked to do so when we hit turbulence. The staff did their best - they had my sympathy. I will continue to fly Air Canada but never Rouge again. When I can I will fly transatlantic on European carriers out of Montreal (Air France or KLM).

"I've flown United Airlines many times, mostly domestic. They've been equally bad each time, but this flight bothered me more since it was a long flight. And maybe I've been spoiled by other good airlines that operate US-Asia routes. The plane looked a little old. Seats were pretty small (for reference, I'm 158cm tall). The entertainment screen looked like one from 20 years ago: touch screen, but you press five times and it still goes to the wrong button. However, they had a decent selection of movies and shows. I tried to play a movie but it kept freezing every five minutes. At first I thought it was just mine who had problems, so I pushed the call button for a flight attendant. 30 minutes later, no sign of any flight attendant, I gave up and already prepared to sleep for the remaining 12 hours of the flight. It turned out later, it was an issue with the whole entertainment system on that flight. After they reset the system, which took another 20 minutes, mine worked ok, but I know I was one of those lucky ones. The food onboard was terrible. I was pretty hungry but still didn't finish any of the meals they gave me. Well, they got me to Tokyo in one piece, so at least there's that. Bottom line: don't fly with United Airlines if you have/can afford other options.",Detractor

FCO-YYZ in Business Class. Boarding at FCO from a seemingly temporary hall (terminal H) without enough seating space then by bus to the aircraft. Staff courteous but not very well trained or competent. Seats in Magnifica class recline to almost horizontal but still at an angle of some 15 degrees from horizontal which pushes your feet towards the footrest not very comfortable. My own seat could not return to complete upright but none of crew seemed to notice. Moreover pitch and width are less than other airlines in Bus. class. Inflight entertainment is pathetic with portable screens supplied on request. Food just acceptable. Good punctuality.,Passive
"  Flew Baltimore to Louisville. This was the 2nd time I flew with Southwest and I experienced 2 rude flight attendants. I was the last to board because my 2.5 year old had to go to the bathroom as people were getting in line to start boarding. Thank goodness we did not miss the flight. When we boarded (last) there were no two seats left together and an older male attendant muttered ""that's what happens when you board last when you have a child with you,"" as he passed us by. I was greatly offended as I could not control the circumstances. Two kind gentlemen gave up their seats for us. My son fell asleep soon after take off and the window blind was jammed/broken in a half closed position with the sunlight in my son's face. There was a ripped page of one of their brochures so I tucked it under the window blind. As we were about to land, another attendant annoyingly asked, ""Did you rip that? Give it to me"" and took it. How rude.",Detractor

"  Flew from Beijing to Chengdu with Air China on a Boeing 737-800 in June 2016. The check-in was quite easy. Though the flight was delayed by more than an hour, we weren't informed till the last minute. Instead of apologising for the delay, the staff argued with us and gave nonsense excuses. While boarding the flight we were not welcomed by the cabin crew. The food was very poor and wasn't hot at all. The cabin crew had no smile on their faces and with poor language skills. The seats weren't comfortable due to hard cushioning and the legroom was comparatively better. I was very shocked with such a bad customer service and I will never choose Air China in future.",Detractor
"  Flew Dublin to Toronto. Despite all the rage I read against this airline, which made me question whether I had made the right decision, I can say that my experience was not that bad. Upside: Service and food was the same quality as on the previous Air Canada flight (SCL-YYZ). I say it's an upside because I expected it to be much worse. Leg room was ok to me too (I'm 175 cm. tall), though recline was poor. Downsides: No in-flight entertainment (you can rent iPads or use your own device), old aircraft, and no window shade in my seat (broken/removed). I wouldn't fly ACR again, not because I had a bad experience, but because I can get something better for the same price.",Passive
"BKK-HND on 787 cabin typically sterile in the interior design style that is an ""art form"" in Japan. Cabin service was abysmally slow - 1 hour and 40 minutes for drink and meal service to begin. No explanation given as to why there was a delay. Once completed the cabin service area became a hub for Duty Free dispensation for the remainder of the flight with staff arriving and departing from all directions through the Business Class cabin to take orders and deliver goods all of this at the expense of the well-being of Business Class passengers. Return flight HND to BKK on 787 was much better organised than the outbound catering-wise and there seemed to be none of the Duty Free bonanza sale to disturb the Business Class cabin. Overall rather disappointing for the reasons given and the lack of effective response to the issues raised. Check in at HND was slow with only 2 of 4 Business Class counters open at what must be their hub.",Passive
We have traveled 8 international legs with Emirates in the past 16 months so we have had a good opportunity to check out this airline. It is our experience that they are so focused on their business and first class customers that they do not care about economy despite the huge number of passengers that they cram into economy seating. Food takes so long to be served to economy customer that if you are seated towards the back it is cold once it eventually arrives. It is also our experience that you can expect to have you dinner tray on your tray table for at least on hour after you have finished. Service other than for meals is almost non existent and economy is severely understaffed. Legs out of Dubai to Sydney are particularly bad and the check in processes in Dubai simply terrible - long queues and slow processing. Inflight movies limited. Every time we have flown from Dubai to Sydney there has been a huge hassle with our seating despite having booked our seats months in advance. One time my husband and I were not seated together despite having been allocated seating together - they gave our seats to a sporting group. It is our opinion that this airline does not care about economy class customers. We have flown with many other airlines so have a good idea of the basic standard that one would expect in economy and in our opinion Emirates does not meet event the most basic standard.,Detractor

"Two different flights: AZ300 and AZ305 LIN-CDG-LIN as a Skyteam transit flight. Flights both on time. Crew were not really that nice. On the return flight the crew waited until descent to serve and this caused confusion onboard. Everything was good for a 1.5 hour flight but the thing I can't stand is the check-in service in Linate. I had a skyteam ticket on multiple airlines (AZ/DL/AF). Each site of the selected airline pointed me to each other and when I was able to do it on the AF site the tool didn't make it possible to change seats. Called AZ and they didn't answer called AF in Italy and they didn't answer called AF in France and they said the entire site had a problem so it was impossible to check-in online. Went to LIN ground staff pointed us to the compulsory ""self check-in"" that surprise didn't worked either. Finally they let us check-in at the usual desk and everything was good.

However, we were positively surprised by the very efficient check-in at LIS, which hardly took about 20-30 minutes from getting to the airport to passing the security control (and we even had oversized luggage). Flight started on time and arrived even before schedule in VIE. Plane was clean, leg room was what you can expect these days in economy class in Europe. Food was consistent with an afternoon flight.

While waiting an hour on the plane in Harare the mass cleaning crew come on board you can't use the toilets no drinks are served you feel like you're in the way as you lift your legs for the vacuum cleaner. Emirates also fly the Lusaka / Harare route but at least have the consideration to stop in Lusaka then Harare so the plane is empty for cleaning before setting off again.

"Copa Airlines flight from Cartagena to Mexico City with a layover in Panama. Flight was 15 mins late arriving to Panama. They did not allow us to board the plane because they said our checked luggage wouldn't make it on the plane. Needles to mention that on our flight to Cartagena our bags were delayed over a day! They finally informed us that we will be on a flight this evening and will have to sleep over in Mexico City. We informed them, which they were already aware, that we are traveling with a small pet, which we of course had to pay Copa to travel with us. They just informed us that the hotel accommodations they have for us will not allow the dog in the room but will have to be left in the ""service (laundry)"" room overnight. We informed the rep that this was unacceptable and we needed them to help us find alternate accommodations. I looked on hotels.com and found 24 hotels in Mexico City that are pet friendly. The rep informed me that my only other option was to sleep at the airport. Our flight doesn't leave until tomorrow at 9am. It was very clear to me at that moment that the rep has no intention of making things right and is not customer focused and has no idea the inconvenience that the airline has caused us. When I asked to speak to her supervisor she said that she was the highest rank at the airport and that no one else could help me. I really find this very hard to believe. Now I have no option but to pay for my own hotel in Mexico City even though all this was caused by them.",Detractor

"  We went back to Qatar Airways after a disappointing flight with Emirates recently and were very happy that we did. Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar. We've also seen dates where Qatar is considerably cheaper than Emirates. To sum up, flying with Qatar still feels like 'real' business class.",Promoter
"  Joon (operated by AF) from Cape Town to Paris offered a satisfactory business class experience. Configuration was 2x2x2 which made access to the aisle a bit difficult as you had to climb over the person occupying the other seat. Service was friendly from a young crew. Food was OK. The almost flat bed was reasonably comfortable and I had a good sleep. The business class from Paris to Toronto on the 777 offers the pod-style in a 1x2x1 configuration giving everyone aisle access. Service was efficient, friendly and comfortable. Food OK. Enjoyed the snack prior to landing. Lie flat bed was good and I thoroughly enjoyed this business class experience.",Passive

The negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable - on both flights the IFE had to be re-set at least once.

" Indianapolis to Las Vegas. Horror show: worst flight in 60 years of flying. Plane from Las Vegas arrived in time around 7pm for our return in it to Las Vegas, supposedly continuing to my destination that night arriving at 1am the next day. But there was a problem with some landing gear. We waited for repairs until 1 am, when we were told that the plane would not be fixed, and hotels for overnighting were being searched for. At 4:30 am we were told that they had been found, but out in suburbs, and we would have to find and pay for our own transportation to get there. A special flight was being added the next day for us at 1pm. A high stack of thin foam mattress pads was wheeled out for us to sleep on the floor. I chose that option with a bunch of other intrepid souls, not liking the transportation options and the few hours for sleep allowed in the distant hotel offering.... I wondered at the time that a company would happen to have a supply of mattresses on hand like that. The next day, I got on that 1pm flight to Las Vegas, then caught a quick standby flight to Portland--but my luggage did not make it. Spirit's baggage handling was not available by phone, and I had reservations to continue by vacation hundreds of miles away the next day by car. By wandering around in the airport, the next morning, I spotted my small red suitcase behind a glass fronted storage cabinet... by asking a Security Guard, I got some advice about getting help from an Arrivals desk near the vacant Spirit desk, who had a key to it! On my return home, on an overnight flight sitting upright in a chair, which I have never tried to sleep in before, I did not get any sleep. The cost-cutting non-reclining seats were an inspiration from hell, and the desk-bound decision maker's purchase of bungee straps to hold safety cards and not a pouch to store waterbottles in so they did not roll dangerously about on the floor should be used to replace chairs for these idiots to sit on!",Detractor
" Sydney to Brisbane via Townsville. Was going to arrive late for this flight due to unforeseen circumstances and could not even locate a number to alert the check in desk that I would be on the flight but was late (by late I mean, I would arrive twenty minutes prior to aircraft departure). When I arrived, there was no check in worker to alert the gate of my late arrival and as such I arrived at the gate two minutes after boarding had closed. With the aircraft sitting still on the tarmac for another ten minutes, I pleaded with crew to assist me as I was there but they were very reluctant to help me and did not offer any help in rescheduling me a flight beyond telling me I could sit at the gate and look up other flights. Will never attempt to fly with Qantas again and do not recommend this airline to anyone who apparently does not possess the ability to see into the future and predict if they will be late.",Detractor

This is the first time I have used the new Garuda direct flight from London Heathrow to Jakarta - the flight itself was very good and it was great to have a direct flight. Check-in was at Terminal 3 of Heathrow in area G which is small, but efficient. The lounge that Garuda uses is the No 1 lounge which is ok, however can get overcrowded. I found the check in and escort through security to be good, however fast track in London Heathrow is not fast track as there are long queues. The flight itself was very good with only a short delay in taking off, which is to be expected at Heathrow. The flight landed in Jakarta close to the schedule arrival time and Garuda ground staff provided great service through immigration and my luggage was with me within 10 minutes of my arrival.

We paid top money for Club Europe and upon leaving the UK we thought it was well worth it as great helpful check in fast track immigration and lovely lounge. Once on plane saw a number of economy passengers throw their hand luggage up in the open lockers above the Club Europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the Club Europe passengers had no room to put their hand luggage. Service and meals were average but really not worth the extra money especially once we got to Rome when all the Club Europe Passengers luggage was last off we waited close to 30 minutes. Hopefully British Airways will sort out the Rome baggage handlers. Flying them again next week we hope for a better experience.,Passive
" Gatwick to Faro. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don't ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it's a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.",Passive

Even though we were delayed a bit we still had a good flight. The service was great. We had complimentary drinks and the food a cheese plate was delicious and was worth the $7 dollar price. On the flight out to LAX we were delayed from 6am to 11.45am due to maintenance issues. Because of this they rebooked all of the people traveling to Mexico and the first class passengers. They also gave $40 breakfast vouchers. This proves excellent service. Also the first officer took us on a tour of the cockpit which was really nice. Since so many people left this flight onto a flight to Mexico the flight was almost empty. The seats were very comfortable on the Boeing 737-400 and the food and service were great as well especially because they were handing out every order for free due to the delay. Because of this Alaska Airlines is a great airline and I definitely recommend.,Promoter
IAD-AMS-RIX (Air Baltic codeshare on the intra-Europe portion) on 9th July returning 17th. The fare was surprisingly low for this time of year (under $900) but the service was top-dollar. Seats on A330-200 were maybe a tiny bit tight but basically comfortable overall (took an aisle seat toward the back with fewer seats in the rows). A full plane but any situations were quickly dealt with by the friendly helpful cabin crews departures and arrivals were quite punctual and connections were handled perfectly. Decent meals (with freshly warmed bread rolls served from a separate basket - a nice touch) and plenty of drinks available throughout the flight.

Not the efficient service we are used to in Singapore! On return flight we experienced bad turbulence (worst we frequent fliers had ever experienced). At no point did the captain speak to the passengers to apologize explain or reassure and as it was night the FAs were nowhere to be seen. Furthermore 3 TVs for my family of 5 were not working and all the FAs did was repeatedly restart the system. We asked to change seats as plane was not full but had to organize with with other passengers to ensure our kids weren't sitting alone.

Chicago-Delhi-Bangalore. Aircraft from ORD-DEL was a Boeing 777-300 majestic look from outside but once you get in the flight you get to see a few unpolished areas seats are ok not great. Decent leg room. Cabin crew don't smile much and have to be called a thousand times to attend your request. Choice of inflight entertainment was limited with a lot of ancient Hindi movies and English movies. Food was good. The ticket price was sky high because I booked it 3 days in advance but the service I got was below mediocre. Once you arrive in Delhi having to collect my checked in bags and to check in again is a complete hassle.,Passive
"  Buenos Aires to Madrid. Another cramped, uncomfortable long-haul Iberia flight with minimal and poor quality food and services. This 12 hour flight had the added distinction of being on an ancient plane effectively no inflight entertainment, unless you count a single old CRT monitor at the from of each cabin. Following a missed connection in Madrid on the outbound journey to Lat Am rushing from T4 to T4S, we managed to make this connection as we did not have to change terminals. Connection time was 1hr 25mins, but this was barely enough. We made the gate with seconds to spare. T4S is vast and we and several passengers had to run like crazy for a very long distance to make the gate in time. Such was the panic and stress that two of our fellow passengers did not even have time to put their shoes back on after removing them for security, and did the remainder of the run in their socks. I will never use Iberia again for long-haul or connect in Madrid.",Detractor

"My wife and I had a horrible experience in a round-trip international flight with United Airlines. In our departure flight, when we wanted to check in at SFO, United staff told us that United would not deliver our baggage in our final destination and we would need to pick up our baggage in our second stop, Dubai. When we tried to pick up our baggage in Dubai, airport staff said UAE visa is required to go to baggage claim area and since we did not have UAE visa, they didn't allow us to pick up our baggage. After lots of negotiations and asking several people for advice, we found out that we would need to pay $84 to transfer our baggage. Our flight back to US was supposed to be operated by Austrian Airlines (we bought the round-trip ticket from United) with 2 stops in Vienna and Zurich. When we went to airport, Austrian Airlines staff didn't allow us to check in. They said that flight from Vienna to Zurich is a domestic flight in European Union and would require Schengen Visa. So, we had to reschedule our flight with Lufthansa, we paid $1000 and could get another flight for 2 days later. If United had informed us about those issues when we bought the ticket or even at the airport, none of those problems would have happened. I asked United to reimburse us for all those extra costs but they only offered us two $150 flight certificates, which are basically useless, most of the time United tickets are more expensive than other flights and those $150 dollar certificates hardly have $20 cash value each. They don't even have a phone number for complaints. The only way you can contact them for complaints, is email or voicemail. I think they have so many complaints that they cannot handle, so they have decided to just offer $150 to $200 to anyone who fills out a complaint instead of hearing the details and trying to improve their customer service. Be very careful when you fly with United. Check all the single details of your trip, take some food with you in long flights and do not expect them to answer their phone. The moment you pay for the ticket, you are on your own.",Detractor

" Tokyo Haneda to Vancouver. After six flights with ANA, this is still my favourite airline. I have flown with other airlines, everything from budget to business, but ANA's excellence in food, service, and product make it my top pick. Even in economy class I felt like a valued customer. The service is friendly and requests are handled quickly. The washrooms are kept very clean. If I had to list two areas for improvement, it would be the following: The first meal is great. I think it is delicious and excellent value for economy class. However, it is so good that it makes the second meal inedible. On both flights (YVR-HND, HND-YVR), that sandwich in a box is the biggest disappointment. I would almost prefer it not be served at all. Seriously, the Moroccan chicken on the way to Tokyo was great, but while ANA has upgraded from a white sandwich box to a fancy blue one over the years, that sandwich still looks and tastes like sadness and disappointment.

Very mediocre experience and an airline I'll be avoiding in the future. I was flying direct London to Beijing but the quality was worse than some domestic Chinese flights I've taken. I had to change seats a grand total of 4 times. Each time because my inflight entertainment system wasn't working and it wasn't until my fourth seat that the screen was working. During this time the stewards and stewardesses were co-operative in helping me find a seat but not kind or apologetic in any way. As for the food the quality of the Chinese meal was somewhat better than the Western meal but neither especially good. My main complaint about the Western meal was the lack of vegetables and meat. The service was perfunctory and the stewardesses stern and at times rude. I just think they have no concept of what customer service is. They warmed to me slightly as I speak Mandarin and was travelling by myself. All in all Air China will get you from A to B and the stewardesses will bring you your food and drinks but whether or not you have a relaxing enjoyable flight is another matter. Wouldn't recommend them and would prefer to pay extra or fly to China indirect next time to avoid them.,Passive

Similar on return flight, not very helpful and disputed office hours posted on the office door in the Bogota airport, they were nowhere to be found. My concern was the possibility of missing my connecting flight in the US due to their delays and the short layover they booked in Houston. Again, no one cared or tried to be helpful. And missed flight, lost baggage and standing in another huge line trying to get things figured out! Will never recommend United Airlines.",Detractor

This week we made the mistake of using basic economy which really means only middle seats in the back of the plane. Had we known that we would have picked a different option.

" Auckland to Houston. Seat 2K is a window seat on the right side of the cabin. It is row two of the nine rows in Business Class on version 2 of ANZ's 787-9. Three seats abreast herringbone configuration. The crew walks past this seat, over and over, delivering food and drinks to the seven rows of business class passengers behind it, as do passengers on their way to the business-class galley and restrooms. On my outbound flight to Auckland I sat in the last row of business class. It was a better, quieter, more private experience. Overhead storage for seat 2K, like all other window seats, is consumed by bedding. The first three rows of the center section have zero overhead storage (though the bedding can be stored behind those seats), so the passengers in the center seats must use the storage space that would have otherwise been available to passengers in the window seats. The fellow from the center seat had already filled the half of the bin that was not filled with bedding. Space is limited to begin with, and there is no usable underseat space. I pulled my mattress and pillow out of the overhead storage bin so that the fellow in the center seat and I could both stow our carry-ons. When the FA told me I couldn't put the mattress in the sizable, yawning cavity behind my seat, I told him he should try to find a space for it. So he took it away into the nether regions of the forward galley. As I sit here, my shoes are under the ottoman and there's a pillow and blanket on the floor where my feet are supposed to be. There's no armrest for my right arm. Crew is really nice in dealing with my, er, ""concern"" about the lack of storage space. Probably as exasperated about it as I. They are as pleasant, tactful, and as helpful as they can be. Really delightful people, dealing with what seem to be poor design features. They served champagne before departure, and that was nice. There's a little fold-out shelf behind my right arm and shoulder, but I don't know that it has any practical use. It is also lit, for some reason known only to Boeing and, presumably, ANZ. It's certainly not a place to put an empty champagne glass. The ANZ headphones are not good. I'd advise travelers to bring their own headphones. There's a jack to plug them into so that you can listen to the inflight entertainment, and both a USB charging port and a 110v outlet for your own devices. As I found on my previous long-haul ANZ flight on the same aircraft type, there appears to be a heat source under the seat. After a short time lying in the bed it becomes sweltering hot. I found the bed itself, under the mattress, to be warm. Very uncomfortable when used as a bed. The plane has large windows but they are behind you, so looking out of them requires turning your head more than 90 degrees. The view out the window would be better than the view of the feet and unclad legs of the person across the aisle, who's wearing shorts and went to bed shortly after takeoff, before dinner. Food is delicious and plentiful. Snacks are available any time. Overall, ANZ's service is excellent, both on the ground and on the plane. The crew was marvelous. The aircraft is new and modern. But the seat layout and design, the lack of storage space both in the overhead and around the seat, and the temperature of the bed leaves much to be desired. As a result, I'm not sure the additional cost of a business-class ticket is worth the money.",Passive
" Baltimore to Frankfurt via Keflavik. I am writing this review based on my experience with the WOW air customer service, after issuing a complaint. I was flying with WOW air in Dec 2016 from the USA to Germany. The comfort on the flight is low. Beverages and food are not included in the ticket fare. My flight left BWI 3 hours late. I missed my connection flight in KEF to FRA due to that. I was told, that I would take the same flight that I had missed on the next day. Instead, I was send to COP where I had to take another flight to FRA. This resulted in a 36h delay. There were direct flights available from KEF to FRA, but WOW air refused to book those. Moreover, I had to pay in COP again for my luggage. Up to this day, I did not receive any kind of compensation. I registered a claim right after Christmas in 2016. I called and contacted the customer service several times and was always told, that my case would be send to a supervisor as a priority. Nothing happened.

I flew First Class from LHR-AUH-SIN-BNE and back again. I must say the service was excellent. Our steward was very attentive and only wanted to please. The food was excellent although I did expect breakfast to be served a bit earlier on when flying from SIN-BNE. I was slightly disappointed with the Inflight Entertainment system. It was not as good as British Airways simply because there was not as much choice. On the return journey it seemed like I had watched everything twice over. However I rather liked how the system did not turn off when the plane was beginning it's descent as it often does with other airlines. The steward was very helpful when it came to disembarking the plane. I was struggling to unload all my things and manage to my two young boys. He took my boys and led them off the plane.

SYD to PEK then PEK to LHR Airbus 330-200 second 777-300. After reading so many negative reviews my expectations were very low and I was dreading the experience as I had never flew business class before apart from Jetstar business. Having said this we were pleasantly surprised at the service food and the cabin. Both flights were without a doubt the best trip I've had. Comfortable beds totally lie flat in Airbus around 30 in business class so it was extremely quiet and personal. Toilets were always clean FA were attentive whilst they may have had difficult in speaking fluent English we got by. Inflight entertainment was the only drawback in terms of selection not up to date movies but nonetheless there was something you could see. As this was a night trip I enjoyed the sleeping arrangement more. We had a layover in Beijing to break the trip. The other leg to London plane was newer and business class had about 80 people so I think the attentiveness from FA was a little less but that's understandable again food bed and toilets were great.

Fast forward into boarding and even though the departure time was 8.50am, we only started boarding after 9am. Then there was a further delay of around 1 hour in the aircraft pushback so the flight actually departed at around 10.40am which was not expected and disappointing. The Business Class seats in themselves were pretty good and the in-flight service was exceptional with a welcome watermelon juice drink, crew being engaging, friendly and personable. For Breakfast, I had opted for the cheese omelet which tasted very good along with coffee and croissants.

My husband had just passed away due to agent orange exposure and I was devastated and still confused because of his death. But this employee wouldn't listen at all as I tried to explain to her I had checked In already, along with my son and young grandson. She just kept saying get in line, where people were checking bags, we had no bags to check in with and by this time it was 5:15 and had to wait in line for over 45 minutes with people that were checking their bags. Running to security, then to gate ( I had hurt my back and have horrible sciatica down my leg) but my son ran a head and got to the gate at 5:55. The attendant told us the doors just closed and we were unable to board plane. So we missed our plane home after a very emotional 2 days, because an employee at the check in wouldn't take the time to look at my phone and explain I could use that for boarding pass and did not need to wait in line for 45 minutes. I will never use this airline again. Also now reading others experience with this airline ( should have known better when calling with questions before even leaving for this trip. The customer service for this airline is just as bad, no matter what button you press for a question. They also have NO discounts for families of Americans veterans, money is all that matter to this airline. Never again will I ever use this airline, no compassion, no help with questions from their customers. Horrible!!",Detractor
Just returned to Edinburgh today on QR027 from Doha on Dreamliner. As this is a day flight leaving at 7.30am which is why we booked it does anyone know why every single window blind was put in to blackout mode after breakfast was served (not done by the passengers) and the cabin lights dimmed? Stayed this way throughout flight couldn't even see what the FA was serving us unless you put reading light on. If I wanted the ambience of a night flight I would have booked one! Just wondered if it is Qatar Airways policy to do this even on daytime flights. We were in economy 12 E & F. More legroom on short haul 737s very cramped very disappointed passenger!,Passive
All 4 flights reasonably good (Vienna-Male and back via Istanbul) however mostly unfriendly crew and delays of 2 of 4 flights. The delay as such was not too bad but the frustrating thing was that the pilots gave no information at all to the passengers. Imagine a delay of 1 hour and you sit in the plane and get no information about reason/extent of delay despite begging flight attendants for information. Pilots just did not care about passengers hope it is not the culture of Turkish Airlines. And there are two extremes: no announcements with regard to flight delay but otherwise so many announcements of useless information that passengers really got irritated. I'm sure Turkish Airlines is quite high in the ratio of announcement time versus flying time. Would be good if they reduce the announcement to the extent of other airlines. Please announce/talk less to passengers!,Detractor
" Austin to Indianapolis. Wow, that's all I can say about the super extravagant extortion forced to add a carry on or checked bag. ""Extras"" that are forced onto you if you ever plan to travel with a carry on or checked bag. Almost everybody has at least one or the other with every flight. To add just one bag to your ticket incase you forgot to add or who ever bought your ticket did not know the severity in fees and fines for not doing it at the time of purchase. To add 1 checked bag is $38 + 38.50 carrier chargeable + 4.50 except + air tax 4.00+ fee+ fee+. It was $82.50 for 1small bag that might make carry on size but that charge is super overcharged as well. $82.50! For a ticket that was $42.50, it would have been cheaper to just book 2seats. How in any way does it cost more to stow a bag than fly? How can an airline force such charges? This is an outrageous fee for forgetting or adding a bag. Heaven help me, I just did not know the extremely overpriced extortion fees for just taking 1 small bag. This company should feel ashamed for such extortionate practice! Outrageous!",Detractor
"I have flown with Alitalia a few times, and they seem to disappoint me on each trip. On this trip I flew from Milanâ€“Malpensa to Abu Dhabi. The premium economy seats are worse than the economy seats, I personally found the economy seats more comfortable.

" Terrible experience all the way around. Frontier Airlines are so dishonest. The seats are terrible and crowded, staff beyond rude. The cost of flight tickets doubled by the time I paid for carry on baggage (yes you have to pay to carry on anything), paid to sit next to my young children. Ridiculous. We were stuck sitting on the runway for hours, wouldn't let us off the plane, it was so awful. We lost an entire day of vacation, no compensation whatsoever.

"  Travelled to Bangkok recently for work. Tired old plane with vintage entertainment system. Drinks were served before dinner, no nuts/crisps available followed by a passable but small dinner. As it was around 20.30 uk time, I pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. After a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service. Incorrect drinks were then brought. My colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait. Eventually the correct drink was brought. I've written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from British Airways. I've flown BA a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it's disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going. The company I was working for paid for the ticket so I don't know what it cost but don't imagine it was cheap. In their defence, I flew back with them from Delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff.",Detractor
Avianca was my choice on my last trip to Washington with an 1 hour connection in Bogota. Nice planes (A330/A320) good flight attendants IFE.

Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.,Passive
"MEL-LHR on QF9 - A380 on 8 Feb 14 Business Class. The A380 is easily the quietest and nicest airplane to fly on. Staff and service were near faultless on both legs (Melbourne to Dubai and then Dubai to London). They were attentive knowledgeable and efficient. The meals were pretty good in general. I had a rack of lamb for dinner with some quality wine. What I'm not happy with though are the Business Class seats. They are very ordinary indeed and there are much better offerings available from many other airlines. The seats are ageing lack storage space and seem to have functions that no longer work - at least my seat was like this. Wobbly armrest and a TV that wouldn't lock down in place. The footrest is particularly uncomfortable as in its folded position it sits ""proud"" of the rest of the seat. The tray table was unsteady and made for some interesting balancing acts for food and drinks. There is very limited space to put drinks on the narrow shared arm rest between seats with not enough room for two drinks to sit side by side. If you have a window seat you don't have direct access to the aisle and end up having to leap over the person next to you if they have their seat extended for sleeping. Even with the new ""mattress"" to put on top of the seat for sleeping the seat is still hard and you end up with sore hips / back after a short period of lying down. The service was great - friendly and efficient. They're charging a premium price without providing a premium product.",Passive

"I was worried about this Ukraine International trip since we were going for a short holiday to Milan and I did not want to lose time on missed flights or luggage. However the price was so cheap in comparison with other options that eventually we decided to take the risk. Overall it was a very pleasant surprise. All flights were on time, transit at Kiev's impressive new airport is a breeze, because the airport is not really busy. Only one of the Boeing 737 was new, but the older planes had bigger and more spacious seats that were more comfortable than European business class on more established airlines. Our luggage was delivered promptly every time. Onboard there is no service whatsoever in economy, and the cabin crew, while not particularly friendly, just got on with what they had to do. A great value for money and will for sure fly them again if they remain so competitively priced.",Promoter

"Sydney to Christchurch. Arrived about 07:45 for 10:15 scheduled departure. Upon arrival at the airport it was obvious something was up, check-in row was E, queue snaked all the way to C. It took about 40 minutes for someone from Emirates to show up, in flight attendant gear, that knew what was going on (destination immigration system down, requiring manual checking of passports, etc). Some supervisors walked around looking harried, and useless. Anyway, having done online check-in again saved some time. Overall check-in would have taken more than an hour. At check-in desk I was made to take my cameras out of carry on and put camera bag in hold (12 kgs, my partner had less so we would have been within the allowance of twice 7 kgs but got ""it is for your safety"" lines, full flight etc), never had to do that. Anyway my lenses survived the trip. What was worse is that rules seemed totally inconsistent in terms of application. Hold luggage we had no more than 2/3 of our 32 kgs each allowance. Onboard service in line with Emirates reputation, in terms of quality of seating (Boeing 777-300 with ten across) food, friendly attendants, 13 languages across them). Upon arrival in NZ very surprised with both passport control and customs/ quarantine being so friendly compared to Sydney Airport.",Passive
" Rome to Barcelona. I flew a round trip with Ryanair recently in September 2018. The first trip was not very good, it was Rome to Barcelona taking off at midnight. The flight was delayed 1.5 hours and by the time I got there public transportation was finished and I had to pay for a taxi to my hotel. Also all throughout the flight, the most annoying part were the flight attendants. Nobody else was talking except for them, chatting with each other the entire time about their boyfriends. Very unprofessional. The second time coming back was actually very good. The flight was schedule to depart at 6:30am and it boarded and left and arrived exactly on time. The flight attendants were fine and professional. I guess the key is to choose the first Ryanair flight that leaves first thing in the morning. That way their airplanes are already on the ground and finished their maintenance checks. Their schedules are so packed that if one flight gets delayed during the day, it creates a domino effect that delays every subsequent flight. In conclusion, pretty good value. I had an overall okay experience. Just remember that they will probably be delayed and to make sure that you compensate for this delay for your arrival destination. Make sure you know how to get to your hotel cheaply if it gets super delayed. I would fly again. Oh and don't forget to online check in and print your boarding pass and pay for any check luggage ahead of time.",Passive
" Flew Johannesburg to London Heathrow. I have read many bad reviews of South African Airways so I was pleasantly surprised with our experience on board. Economy seats were comfortable, with sufficient legroom and recline. The only issue being the excessively stiff seat pocket. Anything thicker than a magazine is difficult to stow. On the flight to London we were given dinner and breakfast plus a good selection of drinks. Food choices were OK and if your choice was not in their cart the FA's were happy to find the meal in another cart if they could. They went out of their way to help. Service was generally very friendly, polite and efficient. Cabin crew seemed to be enjoying their job too, which makes a change from the sullen service on some European carriers. Inflight entertainment selections were a bit dated but OK. The major problem was sound quality. On this flight the movie voice soundtrack at my seat was completely garbled (though the music track was fine). Perhaps the different language tracks were interfering. As I mainly wanted to sleep on this overnight flight this was not a big loss. Overall I was satisfied by SAA's inflight service, it was way above expectation.

"Austrian is my favourite airline to cross the Atlantic. I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasn't happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I won't make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesn't have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, it's very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering I've ever had. I actually look forward to all my meals that are prepared by the onboard chef. To end, there is the substantial Austrian coffee menu, which I adore. I love flying with Austrian!",Promoter

BHX-ZRH-SIN on a Fokker 100 followed by an A340-300. Both aircraft's were clearly quite old but very well kept. This was my first time using solely mobile boarding passes on my phone for the entire journey and the check-in and boarding experience was flawless. Check-in desk at Birmingham was kind enough to allow my bag which was almost 2kg over the limit which I was not expecting from a European airline. Zurich airport is definitely a selling point for choosing Swiss stylish easy to navigate and very efficient. Swiss also has probably the best-timed schedules for connecting flights between Europe and Asia. Overall service and hospitality onboard both flights was friendly and attentive almost as good as Asian carriers. Can't say the same about the catering which was rather basic (cold sandwich on a 2 hour full-service international flight is unheard of in Asia no menus offered meal portions intercontinental were on the small side). Upsides were the surprisingly good wine available and the delicious Swiss cheese. The Y seat on the A340 is okay but rather outdated with no in-seat power or foot rest and an annoyingly large IFE box under the window seat. No amenity kits whatsoever on a 12 hour flight but the frequent drinks service was appreciated. Overall a rather average inflight experience for the premium price Swiss typically charges sweetened by the excellent experience on the ground.,Passive

LAX to San Jose Costa Rica with a layover in Ft. Lauderdale. The worst experience on all fronts. Checked-in at the counter as I wasn't sure if my bag was one that I would have to pay for. He told me that as long as I put my purse in my carry-on and only had one item I would be fine. I showed him my bag and he confirmed that I would not be charged for it. However when boarding in Ft. Lauderdale I was stopped by one of their employees who asked me if I paid for my bag. I told her no she asked me if I had used the overhead compartment on my way there and I said yes. She informed me that if I planned to use an overhead bin then I would need to pay them $100 immediately or I would not be able to bring my bag on my flight. I ended up paying the $100 in order to board my flight and I was made to feel like the whole thing was my fault - it was terrible. On the way back home my friend and I decided to go online the night before as we were told that if we pay online we only have to pay $30. When we went to pay their website told us that we were not eligible to make payments at that time. So we still ended up having to pay $50 at the airport check in. Even if that baggage fiasco hadn't happen this flight still would have been awful. The seats are the airline equivalent of plastic picnic chairs and you have to pay for water (even if your flight is 5hrs long). Coming home from San Jose after going through security my friend decided to fill her plastic water bottle so that she could have a little for the flight. Before boarding they announced that they were going to re-search our bags and that we would have to dump out all liquids that we were carrying my friend didn't think that they would actually prevent her from bringing airport water on to the flight but when they checked her bag they told her she either had to dump it or chug it. She chugged it. It is clear that every thing Spirit does is an extra attempt to take more money from you. I understand that they offer affordable flights but it is not worth all of the extra out-of-pocket cash and stress that they cause. I will never fly with them again.,Detractor

" After arriving at the airport at 4:30am in San Diego we flew into Chicago. Little did we know we would not be leaving that airport for 36 hours. Our flight to our destination was scheduled to leave at 6pm. After our gate got changed 10 times and our flight got delayed further and further we scurried up and down stairs to each one. We then arrived at the last gate at 9:30pm. We sat and sat and were told no updates. We then were told we were waiting on the plane to arrive that we were flying out. The plane landed. BUT we only have one pilot, so we waited for another plane to land for a second pilot. Thenone of the flight attendants timed out on her shift and could no longer board our flight home. BUT by the time the other plane landed the staff timed out as we watched them walk right out of the gangway to the plane passed us never to be seen again. So, we waited on another plane for a whole new crew. We were assured for the first announcement over the intercom of the night that we were heading out soon! At this point it is 11:30pm. 30 minutes later, at 12am, we are notified that the flight is cancelled. after waiting 9 hours and running around the airport, it is canceled. This is not even the worst of it. We call United customer service to see what can be done 2 times (go ahead and listen to those calls- they are pathetic) only to be told there are no more flights to JAX and that we cannot be helped. The couple in front of us got another flight booked automatically that left 6am the next day why our customer service experience was so different is beyond me. We ended up buying the only flight we could in a different airport. We ended up purchasing a flight from MDW in Chicago to JAX. Sometime after purchasing the flight I was so relieved to find one! That is until I realized the flight I purchased from Delta airlines was on September 27th when I need to leave ORD right then and there on now what is September fourth. So with even more stress added, I am out over $500 more dollars, I still have no way home, I have nowhere to stay no way to travel, I don't have my luggage, I am defeated. So, after searching for some more time, there are no flights out of ORD to JAX for 2 more days. I ended up purchasing another flight for $935.60 from a different airline and airport in Chicago that did not leave until 1 pm the next day. We were left with no other choice but the sleep on the ground. So, it is now 1:30am. We are wondering where is my luggage that has everything I need in it and were told our luggage went to JAX already without us. It didn't make sense. So, we then stood in another line and were told that our luggage is at ORD but if we exit to get it, we cannot get back in until the morning. So, we agreed to get our luggage in the morning before we spend another $40+ dollars to transfer to MDW where our new flight is.",Detractor

My husband and I travelled Sunwing through Signature Vacations to Costa Rica. We paid extra for Elite Plus and were given row 15 which we were told had extra leg room. It did have extra leg room. It did not however have the ability for the seats to recline. Almost a 6 hour flight with no movement for the seat was very difficult. I recommend Row 16 if paying for Elite Plus as row 16 has the extra leg room and the seat movement. I believe row 14 does not have reclining seats as well but that would need to be confirmed. We left the gate 50 minutes late but I knew this was possible and brought my own snacks and drinks on board as well as my tablet with books and movies so I was able to entertain myself for the trip. The on-board movies were played from drop down units not in seat. The weight limits were difficult especially for the carry on item. The airline did check the weights for some people who looked like they were carrying too much. I do believe that I would try to fly using another airline first and I guess the size of the price difference would make the decision for me.,Passive

Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around. I've already booked another two flights with my favourite airline.,Promoter
Travelled with my wife from London to New York mid Sep 2013. Found 1st class to be a very cost effective alternative to the major airlines on this route. Checked in online and printed out our boarding passes. Check in was smooth and the staff pleasant. Proceeded to the Gulf Air lounge which was pleasant and served a variety of hot and cold dishes and alcohol. Flight was delayed an hour without any announcement or communication from the airline. Staff at the gate were not particularly enthusiastic but boarding was swift and we boarded through the priority lane. Onboard 1st class was clean and looked well maintained though old style. The green fabric seats were clean good size and comfortable but old style and not full sleeper. Seats were sufficiently spaced out. The crew were professional and polite but did not appear friendly or as jovial as major airlines. Offered pre-flight drinks accompanied with smoked almond nuts dates and Arabian coffee. Shortly after take off we were offered drinks and some hors d'oeuvres. Offered portable videos toiletry/vanity pack encased Parker style roller ball pen (souvenir) blankets and neck support cushions. 2hrs into the flight we were served a 4 course meal. The rest of the flight was smooth. Arrived into New York 30 minutes behind schedule. Our luggage came out first as they were priority tagged. Our return journey departed New York on time the check-in was seamless the lounge was good the food great the crew were same and we arrive London on schedule. Overall a good experience.,Promoter
"  Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Thai use wide bodies (a few different ones A350, 777, A330) a few times a day on their domestic BKK to Chiang Mai route which is about an hour long. Downside is you are bused to international side of airport and then walk up a stairway to the jetty vs relocating the airplane to the domestic side, stairs are little challenging if old. I opt for these vs narrow body ThaiSmile or other airlines as there is generally a lot of priority to ensure they are on-time within a small buffer zone of 20 minutes. Seats are good, 9 across in 777 versus the spacing saving in most carriers is evident. Service is rushed given the time, but coffee and small chicken snack. IFE was old but reasonable. Cabin crew are rapid paced which is fantastic, I'd love to see if they have same energy on international legs. I think the 9 across dated cabin would be much better internationally than 10 across, I'd sacrifice the extra 2"" IFE screen for the extra 1"" seat width. Minus a point for no beer available. Overall a great flight.",Promoter
Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.,Detractor

"  Denver to Seattle. I only chose 1/10 because I couldn't choose 0/10!! I booked a flight to Seattle for $165 round trip. When I went to check in online, I was charged an addition $116 for a checked bag, one carry on, and my seat (because apparently your seat isn't included in the purchase price), via ""the perks"" option. This charge stated it was my additional cost for my round trip flight. There was no in flight entertainment, they charged you for refreshments (that they only accepted debit or credit as payment for), and they passed out credit card applications to everyone on board. The seats are miserable and the plane lacked cleanliness. Next came my return flight. I flew out at 6:40 at night. I wrapped up work, and headed to the airport 4 hours early, to check my bag, so I wouldn't have to drag it around. Unlike United, they only show up two hours prior to departure to check bags for the flight, though none of this information is told to you when you purchase your ticket. They also refuse your bag 45 minutes before departure, leaving one hour to check everyone's bags, so the line was huge, and the ticket agent showed up 20 minutes late!! When I finally got to the counter to check my bag, I was charged another $60, and was told ""the perks option only covers a checked bag and carry on on my initial flight, and only my checked bag on my returning flight. Unreal! The return flight was exactly the same as the one here. I basically paid a total of $350 for a crappy flight with poor customer service. I will never fly Frontier again.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Vancouver. Check in was well organized and done quickly. The flight started on time, was a newer aircraft, clean and in good condition.

"Milan-JFK with a 4-hour layover in Madrid. When I asked to confirm my exit row seats on the Milan-Madrid flight assigned on the phone we were told by the gate agent that we had them - row 9 of the 737. That somehow didn't sound right but two agents couldn't be wrong. Of course these were normal economy seats with the spacious 30-inch pitch that tall people love. Luckily the exit row seats (actually row 14) were open and we grabbed them just when the door closed. On Madrid-JFK leg I had paid for the ""extra room"" economy seats something I found out was available by chance on the AE web site. But remember that gate agent in Milan who assigned row 9 as exit? She somehow did know enough to recognize that the assigned ""extra room"" seats were actually a bulkhead row with no extra room. It took several conversations in Madrid to secure actual ""extra room"" seats which are in fact exit rows on the AirBus. This saved the trip back to JFK from being a miserable disaster. We were lucky I guess that things sort of worked out. But I hate to think how many travellers are victims of a staff that needs to go back to basic training. How does this airline function?",Detractor
 Ft Lauderdale to Atlantic City. They actually canceled a flight on Saturday night before Easter ruining I don't know how many plans for numerous families after making us wait almost four hours. They excuse being they didn't have a pilot or crew. They didn't know that eight hours ago? Nobody cares anymore. Not people. Not big companies. All these families plans ruined without any remorse. Just cancel it. I know have to miss Easter with my amazing two year old daughter. Please don't ever use this airline.,Detractor
FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -â€“Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit â€œ hot seatâ€ pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future.,Detractor

Last time I flew my flight got cancelled leaving La Guardia, NY at around 3pm because it was raining and they only booked another flight the next day out of Newark which miles away (in NJ)! Not to mention that it stopped raining about an hour later. Today my flight got delayed for an hour because of a ""maintenance issue"".

" Bahrain to Dubai via Kuwait, first time with Kuwait airways and for sure it will be my last time. Most unorganised and unprofessional airline. If you want to delay and spend hours in airports then this is the airline you choose. Had business trip in Bahrain then Kuwait and back to Dubai. BAH-KWI was delayed by 2 hrs a very old A320 dirty and noisy, uncomfortable leather seats, no screens, dirty toilets. Delay without any information and had to spent hours at BAH for a 50 mins flight. KWI-DXB was even worse at the most chaotic airport in Kuwait which is the hub of the airline. Was at the airport at 7:30am for my 9:45am flight the check in counters are the most unorganised and chaotic. Their ground staff are very rude and keep giving wrong information . It was a remote gate and can you imagine checking in 3 flights at the same time from the same gate. Then suddenly they say my flight is delayed while we were at the gate and flight was removed from the screen then had to check with their airline ground staff who are also rude and unprofessional eventually we leave 2 hrs later with a fairly new A330 aircarft seemed clean however Entertainment not the best and didn't really matter hence a 90 mins flight .

" Booked with Air China mostly for their competitive price. The Airport check in process was acceptable, although a bit understaffed with only 3 counters open for a 300 seat aircraft. The ground staff were very nice to have allocated me an emergency exit row seat, free of charge. Upon boarding one thing that was immediately obvious was the unusually hard cushioning on the seat back, upon close inspection there appears to only be about half a centimeter of foam. The inflight entertainment system also performed mediocrely, with laggy inputs and in this flight in particular requiring 3 separate reboots, with each taking about half an hour. The food and drinks is pretty much what you will find on an international flight like this, although lacking in western style food in general. Overall an average flight that I would recommend if you are either an international studnet or traveling on a tight budget.",Passive

Boarded the rather ageing aircraft with 40 rather cramped seats. Had to ask for a welcome drink, this set the scene for what was to be an underwhelming standard of service throughout the flight. They ran out of the beef entree along with the French red. Champagne was closeted away, the sauce with the chicken was far too salty for my liking. Amenity kit which is touted is very basic does not have a comb, however in its defense it does contain a generic hand sanitizer in gel form however would have been better had this been Purell.

 Sacramento to Edmonton via Portland/Seattle. I will never be flying with this airline again. My party of four got to Portland only to find out that our connecting flight to Seattle was cancelled meaning we wouldn't be able to make it back to Edmonton. After waiting for almost an hour we got to talk to a representative. They were nice but not at all helpful because our party had to be split up and half of us had to stay overnight in Vancouver and half flew took a different flight. I triple check to ensure that my sister who I was traveling with and my luggage ended up in Vancouver with us and I was assured that it would be there for us to pick up. We flew Air Canada which was delayed by 2 hours. Once we landed we went to baggage claim only to find out that our luggage isn't there. Once we start asking around we find out that Alaska Airlines never handed our bags over and so we have no idea where our bags are. I call the Alaska Airlines to figure this out only to be put on hold for 25 minutes and be scolded and talked down to because â€œI should be greatful that they even accommodated me and switched my flights.â€ When they were the ones that cancelled it in the first place. Then I ask where exactly is my bag and get the run around again only to be told it could be in Portland or in Vancouver somewhere or it might even be in Edmonton now. I then asked ok if it is in Edmonton now as you said it could be what's stopping someone from taking my bag before I get there tomorrow?! And she said â€œWell we don't know if it's there so you need to file a baggage claim. And you know what they accommodated you and so you should be happy about that.â€ Needless to say they were not helpful at all. Split up our party and gave me the run around. Not impressed at all.

Business class was wonderful except for the meals and any drinks had to be brought including water.

" London to Ahmedabad via Dubai. I was travelling by business class on the A380 from London to Dubai. I was impressed by the look of the bar and lounge area. I decided to take a couple of pictures and videos of the same to show the look of the lounge to my family. But an Indian flight attendant really rudely asked me to stop clicking pictures and said that if any crew member has been clicked to delete my videos as I can get involved into legal matters. This was embarrassing and humiliating for me as other crew members and passengers could hear this and started staring at us. He would not be wrong in saying this to me but there is a way of requesting for something. I went back to my seat and sat there for a while. I certainly didn't expect this treatment especially from the Emirates crew after paying so much for the service of the business class, my husband being a gold class member.

" Porto to London via Lisbon. I have been flying internationally since 1968, and my experience with TAP has to be by far the worst experience. First we had to make changes to our itinerary at exorbitant cost, and at the airport my wife and I were charge additionally for our luggage - small carry on suit case - 83 Euros. The staff appeared not to have happy lives and were officious at best as they implemented TAP's usury charges. The flight out of Lisbon to London was delayed 2 hours because of heavy rains, and. when we collected our two bag in London we found that they and the clothes inside were soaking wet -- the luggage had obvious been left in the rain during the transfer in Lisbon. When we went to the agency handing damaged baggage in the Heathrow Airport customs baggage retrieval area, we were informed that they didn't handle that kind of damage. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were informed rudely that they were in the ticketing desk outside of customs. No one bothered to check the luggage. Once outside, we found the ticketing desk agent who informed us that the people inside the customs area handle such issues. After a bit of arguing the ticketing agent directed us to the person handling boarding operations. Finally someone not associated with TAP directed us a telephone that we could uses to contact the folks in the customs area. A nice young man finally arrived who made a cursory examination of the wet clothes and luggage and took me back through security to where a supervisor recorded my complaint and gave me instructions as to how to file my complaint with TAP. I pointed out the TAP representative who ignored my presence. It took more than 2 hours to get this done -- a task that should have taken 15 minutes. Base on my experience, I don't have high expectations for compensation for damages (clothes and luggage). After reading some of the other reviews, I can only ask -- Why would anyone fly TAP?",Detractor

We arrived at Wellington airport on 1st March 2015 for our return flight at about 1pm for flight NZ849 due to depart at 3.45 pm with a check-in time of 2.15 pm. We had booked and paid for this flight on 14th August 2014. Normal check-in procedures did not work and we were advised that the flight had a weight problem and we should check back at 2.30. We advised that we would miss a medical appointment made 4 months previously if we did not catch the flight. When we checked back we were advised that we could not go as the plane had a weight issue. Our luggage was not weighed at any time prior to this and was about half of the allowed weight. If the issue really was one of weight then Air New Zealand is obviously incapable of flying with the baggage allowances that it has set and if passengers with half that allowance are denied access to a flight booked over 6 months previously then they should look at a fairer way of deciding exactly who they will allow on planes. It would seem that this was just an excuse and I strongly suspect that the real issue was that Air New Zealand had over-booked the flight and the issue was one of seating on the plane. If this is indeed the case then it would have been better to have been told this from the outset instead of being jerked around by being told to return at 2.30 pm. Air New Zealand did arrange for alternative travel the next day and they did arrange for overnight accommodation with meals (but no drinks at all including non-alcoholic drinks and the meal allowance for dinner was only sufficient for the main course without either entree or dessert). They also provided both of us with $300 travel vouchers with them but we feel that being lied to and treated in a shoddy manner once by a company is unfortunate: to give that company the opportunity of doing it again is stupidity.,Detractor

LGW-ARN return at the time of the pre Christmas disruption. Had booked non flexi tickets some time before for a reasonable price against SAS and full service alternatives - many offering poor connections. I am not used to budget airlines and as we were a family of 4 (2 small boys) I thought they worked out quite costly so I just paid to check a single case. Check in easy and quick. Outbound was delayed a little over an hour - no information volunteered within the airport I had to ask. Equipment was a 737-300 clean and quite nicely designed cabin. Food on board as others commented was expensive bordering on the extortionate and service seemed to take forever - mostly due to the time taken to process payments. I was overcharged for my order but this was rectified when I realised. Return flight was the first successful departure on the route in 3 days the airline had posted basic information on their web site but enough to convince us to make the 320kmtrip to the airport. Severe delays made us very late but check in staff understanding and helpful. In the event though we were only informed of a delay of about 2 hours after the check in had closed - this was attributed to problems at the London end so quite credible (again though information flow pre-boarding was poor). Overall - reasonable service for the money.,Passive
Washington Reagan to Dallas/Fort Worth. The A321 aircraft appeared to be new. Our seats in first class were comfortable with acceptable legroom. The first class cabin was very clean and inviting. Very nice service by the staff and the lunch (a cooked Italian pasta dish and salad ) was not bad. The red wine was OK as well. But where this flight really shined concerned the very impressive inflight entertainment (IFE) system featuring a huge number of video and audio selections as well as an upgraded map display with a number of different views of our flight in progress available.

"  Amsterdam to Lima return via Paris. First part AMS-CDG with KLM 737. Good legroom, friendly staff and good service for this short haul flight. Because it was busy in Amsterdam, flight left too late, but arrived on time. So overall good experience. Arrived in Paris at time. Unfortunately the time at the border control took very long (approx. 1 hour) so I've made it just in time to the connection flight. Second part CDG-LIM won Air France 777-300. Old plane, and so was the IFE. Seats were cramped and legroom was so so. Seat had an USB port. It was a daytime flight of 12,5 hours. After departure (which was on time) the served already the lunch. You couldn't make a choice, and there was no drink service before or a towel. After the lunch was been served we didn't see the crew anymore. If you needed a drink, you had to go the galley by yourself. There were limited snack (little ice creams and small sandwiches). An hour before arrival we got a snack (orange juice, small piece of bread and a cake). It was not much. The food tasted good. Overall I thought that the service was limited (especially if you compare it with other airlines or with partner KLM). You pay a lot of money, and therefore you don't get much service. The same features with the IFE, which had limited options and didn't work properly. So I'm not impressed with the services provided by Air France. Third part was back from LIM-CDG with AF 777-300. This plane was slightly newer, and the legroom felt better, and so were the seats. IFE was still old. This was a night flight. Service started just after departure (same as on the way to LIM only one meal option). The service on this flight was limited too. On a night flight I don't care about that, but in the night your neighbour sometimes want to pass because they wanted some water (they dont walk by once a hour). So that annoyed me. I've slept the most of the flight, despite that my neighbour wanted to pass two times. Second (breakfast) meal was not much, so also here was the service under par. Last part of the journey was CDG-AMS with AF A320. Legroom was ok, seats were good. Service was fine for this short haul flight (sandwich and drinks). I wouldn't recommend flying with AF based on my experiences. You pay a lot money for the ticket, service was limited and the quantity of the food was below par. Furthermore the IFE was old and didn't work properly. The seats are cramped and the legroom was so so. I like to fly with KLM (friendly crew and enough service), but AF is not comparable. So if I book with KLM, I check first if the flight is with them or with AF.",Passive
"Gatwick to Rome. Make sure you read the terms and conditions and pay for seat. Vueling regularly overbook seats. They say you can check in at the airport at no extra charge. I am waiting to leave Gatwick (fog delay). Four empty seats for no shows, but have left three friends behind to wait for the next flight as they hadn't prepaid seats. They were in a wait list and first in line to take the no shows. An absolute shambles. I will never fly with them again",Detractor
  Singapore to Ulaanbaatar via Beijing. Had little choice in choosing operators to Ulaanbataar from Singapore. Either Air China or Korean Air were only valid options but big difference in pricing and timings so was forced to fly Air China. The A330-200 standard economy seats were extremely comfortable for 6-7 Hour flight to/from Singapore Beijing. I am 6ft 3. No issue with legroom or pitch. Aircraft was clean. All flights left and departed close to on time. One delay from Beijing due bussing operations. Cabin crew were pretty attentive. Checked Bags arrived no problem despite very tight connections. In-Flight Entertainment offering for English speakers was quite limited (bring an iPad) and the food offering was very substandard. Ground Staff in Beijing were quite rude. The very bad transit in Beijing can be very frustrating for international transit passengers - 2 needless queues. This is an airport security requirement and appears to be outside airlines control. Recommend sitting in front of aircraft for all arrivals into Beijing to be at the top of the queue.,Passive
CA984 LAX-PEK. On-time departure of a (new) 777ER. Great AVOD with movies in English and Chinese not recent releases but good adequate selection. 2 full meals Chinese fare both consisted of rice or noodles with beef or chicken good and abundant. No western meals menu. Frequent cabin walk-throughs with water. Self-serve refreshment section in the mid-galley. FA's professional and efficient. Great seat pitch and recline on coach. Overall a very pleasant experience on a long haul flight. Boarding was not by row or section just general boarding but surprisingly quick and efficient. Impressed by the nice new 777 ER. My experience was totally contrary to most reviews on CA perhaps the introduction of new aircraft was the key.,Promoter
" Seattle to London via Keflavik. My husband and I bought two way tickets, and somehow we didn't notice that checked bags and food were not included in the ticket price, so we ended up paying over $200 for only one checked bag for both, and meals (meals were rather just a sandwich). Our trip to our destination went well. On our return trip, we had a 25h stopover in Iceland, and leaving Iceland was a terrible hassle, from them giving us a hard time with our toiletries bag (that met regulations, and wasn't a problem in any of the previous flights) so we ended up needing to throw away some of our stuff. Then, we had extra security checks, long lines, that rather made us quite angry, and we are determined not to fly through Icelandair again.",Detractor
 Flew Newark to London Heathrow. United apply the recipe of discount airlines to long flight and this is not going well. Their organisation in Newark airport is chaotic. The entertainment system look like it's from the 90's (Ridiculously small screen and no possibility of movies selection). The inflight service is minimum and/or replaced by paying service.

LHR to Seattle return in WT+ a thoroughly enjoyable experience on each journey. Both flights more or less on time with excellent crew on both legs very attentive and cheerful with plenty of drink runs and quite tasty meals. Entertainment quite good with a huge choice of movies TV and music. On arrival into Seatac I was through immigration and customs with my luggage and in my limo in under an hour. On arrival into Heathrow terminal 5 it took about the same amount of time. I've been flying this route for the past twenty five years on average two to three times a year and BA is certainly the best airline flying to Seattle.,Passive
Flew Business class Doha - Hong Kong Round-trip. Both flights departed on time cabin crew were attentive and friendly. My Muslim meal request was honoured. However I opted for a window seat to look outside the cabin. Unfortunately it seems that CX has a policy of keeping window shades closed throughout the whole flight hence eliminating the purpose of window seat and the enjoyment of flying. I do not recommend flying with this airline if you enjoy window seat. I am a business class passenger and I expected to be treated with respect. Unfortunately this was not the case for me hence encouraging me to fly Emirates and Qatar Airways.,Detractor
One-way PHL-SFO. Since the airline was still new to Philadelphia the check-in line was completely empty. Onboard they offered noise cancelling headphones. The aircraft itself was new. The seats still pretty comfortable leather seats were a little stiff and wouldn't recline.

Finally the staff were not only enthusiastic but they actually took the time to remember and refer to everyone by name.,Promoter
PVG-DEL-PVG in business class. Both flights on A330s but different configs and service levels. Outbound flight was an older plane with 2-2-2 seats that reclined to an angle and did not lie flat. FAs went about their work perfunctorily. The food was very bad - both options were like an economy class meal in terms of taste and quality. They did not have a dessert cart. IFE system had a fair selection of movies. Return flight was better with a newer plane and lie flat seats. FAs were professional and pleasant and spoke English better than the outbound flight. Meals were also tastier. The price for the flight is good but you get what you pay for and quality is uneven.,Detractor
  On time departure from Zurich after an orderly boarding process. Brand new A321 with the latest IFE and comfortable leather seats. Crew were attentive (lack of the onboard chef did not seem to have changed service levels) and the catering was very generous considering the duration of the flight.

Onboard service fairly dismal - a small cold wrap offered by a mostly unfriendly and uninterested crewe xcept one young FA. Cabin felt excessively hot and uncomfortable. Seats fitted with PTVs but uncomfortable. Only water round was before landing on a 5 hour flight - not even OJ offered. Connection in BOG at dawn was fairly easy. Domestic flight was on an A320 fine legroom for a short segment. A drink offered. Crew seemed much more professional and interested in doing their job than the ones on international flights.,Passive

Touch screen easy to use and there were a wide range of movie choices provided. The flight was punctual. The pasta meal on this flight was a disaster. The seat was a shell seat and it was impossible to recline backwards. Instead, you slide forward. The return trip was on the oldest Boeing 777-200, but the flight was better as the seat was a new reclining seat. The same entertainment system despite the age of the aircraft. Cabin crew were indifferent but provided fairly good service. The meal (pork noodles) on this flight was delicious - a huge difference with the first flight. This flight was punctual despite air traffic controls. Fairly good experience with CX.",Passive

" San Francisco to New York. What an unpleasant experience. I flew in on Thursday with economy plus more room seats. On the way back from San Francisco's to NY, the plane was maybe 30% full and mostly empty. We kindly waited for everyone to board to see if the row in front of us which had a few extra inches of leg room would be vacant (I am 6'3 so those extra inches would make a big difference). When the plane doors closed and we were ready to roll, I kindly asked the flight attendant to let me move one row up considering it was empty, she immediately went on the most uncomfortable rant about extremely strict policies (which isn't true I fly with JetBlue and virgin airlines only and always had very nice flight crews tell me absolutely no problem as long as no one sits here when the doors are shut, feel free) long story short the flight attendant was so adamant about not letting me move even though the plane was more than half empty and it was so unpleasant considering I love this airline along with virgin airline. I will no longer fly JetBlue for this reason and this is all about principle. Extremely uncomfortable situation to pretend like they can't move you whatsoever. I will only fly virgin from now on. Customer service skills are terrible.",Detractor
"  Flew Aeroflot from New York to Moscow. To start off, the flight was delayed - nearly 6 hrs. We checked in OK. Managed to get reasonable seats. Even after we boarded, the flight seemed to take forever to take off. Since this is a long flight, we had video entertainment on board and was glad that everything functioned. This was not so on the outward leg of this journey - nothing worked then. The food was passable. The little white bread roll was tough enough to be shoe leather. However, the drinks were completely miserly. Barely one glass of low quality wine. No spirits, no beer. Our next flight out of Moscow was again over 6 hr later. Over 6 hr flying time to Dubai, but there was no video entertainment on board. This is standard on most airlines where one's flight is over 3 hrs. Food - passable low quality. Along with the likes of American Airlines, Delta, I will definitely avoid Aeroflot in the future. The airline, is definitely not in the same league as Emirates or Qatar.

Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic.

"  Flew Sydney to Singapore. A frustrating start to my journey as confusing signage at SYD led me to the wrong check-in area, before a staff member rather rudely redirected me to a desk for online checked-in passengers - even though the desks in the area I was queueing for said the same thing. The flight got off to a shaky start too, as boarding was delayed for more than half an hour with no explanation from gate staff other than two vague and non-reassuring references to a ""technical issue"". I was certain we'd be very late, however to Qantas' credit they made up time with the quickest boarding I've ever seen and we departed less than 5 minutes behind schedule. On board, the A330 was comfortable and modern and the IFE was amongst the best I've seen - certainly on par with Emirates in terms of quality, although perhaps not quite so much choice (but certainly more offerings to my taste). The 2-4-2 seating layout makes the A330 the ideal aircraft for travelling in a couple. Some crew were friendlier than others but overall I felt looked after. The meal choices were rather limited although the food was of a good quality. I would have preferred more frequent snacks. Service was excellent for the first part of the flight but all but disappeared around half way - disappointing as I would have preferred further drink and snack runs and was left hungry. To be fair, some turbulence late in the flight precluded the crew from offering a full service. Arrival in Singapore was smooth, with efficient deplaning and quick baggage offload. Overall a very comfortable and satisfying flight, Qantas could be excellent if a couple of customer service issues could be ironed out.",Passive

"Good value good inflight service but Sunwing dropped the ball badly on our recent return flight from Cancun to Ottawa (Mar 26). First the pick up from our resort to the airport was far too early (5.50 am pick up for a 10.40 am scheduled departure). On arrival at Cancun airport none of the Sunwing reps there could say which counter we should go to for check-in. We wound up standing in an uncertain line for more than an hour before Sunwing staff finally showed up to begin the check-in process. It makes no sense to transport passengers to the airport more than an hour before Sunwing staff will begin the check-in process. Second and more disappointing was the way they handled and failed to keep passengers informed about the departure delay back to Ottawa. We later learned that a flight attendant had suffered a medical emergency on the flight into Cancun that would prevent them from working our flight back to Ottawa. Obviously Sunwing isn't responsible for something like this which is totally out of their control. However it took Sunwing more than an hour to relay this information to passengers. Instead they simply provided rolling notifications of boarding time delays at times posting new departure times that were already outdated when they were posted. When they notified passengers to come to the gate to receive news of the flight status they failed to give the Sunwing rep a microphone-so very few passengers could actually hear news about the medical status of the flight attendant or that Sunwing was looking for 20 ""volunteers"" to relinquish their seats on our flight to take a connecting flight through Toronto or what the details of the Toronto connecting flight were. Ultimately the situation was resolved when another Sunwing attendant agreed to step in for their unwell colleague and everyone was able to fly direct to Ottawa - albeit 1.5 hours late. Sunwing must do a better job of keeping its passengers informed and in communicating with them.",Passive
" Delhi to Paris. I had my worst flying experience so far with this company. I had my retrun flight from Delhi on April 29th 2019.

After about 10min, when finished with the ""out of nowhere"" customer, he handed me back my passport while telling me that my flight is tomorrow.

After getting my boarding card for tomorow's flight I went to Air India's agency to demand an accommodation or any other assistance while waiting for my flight the next day. The only answer I've got is that there is nothing I can get on the spot and all I can do is to send a complaint by email to ask for compensation. If possible, avoid Air India at all cost.

" Helsinki to Bangkok via Kiev. Beware plane type change on their long haul routes. I got a very tempting economy ticket offer from UIA on route HEL-BKK (only 150 euros one way base fare) on their B777. Shortly after booking I was offered to upgrade to business class for an extra 280 euros and I pulled the trigger knowing the good reviews on their business class on B777. I thought that a long haul business class ticket at this kind very low price was almost too good to be true, which turned out to be exactly what it was. However, about two weeks before the departure I got an email notifying about schedule change for one hour earlier departure time in Kiev. That was all the information which was given. At this point I should have already guessed the reason for it. Everything went smoothly as expected until I stepped onboard the plane which was charged for their much older B767 type in Kiev. These planes are known to have very bad reviews for their comfort, not only in economy but also in the business class which is comparable to today's premium economy class at its best (e.g. seats are reclining nowhere near flat as in the the B777). Not only these old planes have very noisy cabin for modern standards, they also are slower which means longer flight time (hence the advanced departure time), not to speak of such luxuries as in-flight entertainment, adjustable air ventilation or wifi connection. The cabin temperature was also unbearable high and I had to notify about it to the cabin crew several times before they adjusted it to the lowest possible level (according to them), which meant that the lavatory and cabin crew resting area in front of the business class cabin went extremely cold (undoubtedly the reason why the crew wanted to keep it higher). There were a couple of small children which were screaming all the time and would not settle to sleep until the cabin temperature got lower and the mothers were told about the disturbance they were causing (which the cabin crew reluctantly finally did). Needless to say that even after that there were no question to get any real sleep due to the horrible cabin noise and limited recline of the seats. I am absolutely certain that the airline was completely aware of the plane type change well in advance and that was the real reason for the advertised cheap fare price. I call this a deliberate scam from the airline. This a certain way to lose returning customers so all in all never again UIA.",Detractor

Booked our trip from the Bahamas to Canada on May 15th from Air Canada. After hearing about Rouge I wondered and checked the reservation. It was Air Canada Rouge where the seats have been taken out replaced with cheaper shorter seats with no inflight entertainment or even a plug and they have added 2 rows. Not wanting to endure that flight with nothing to do I loaded the laptop with stuff to watch. We boarded and found out the man in the window seat had taken my aisle seat. After we fixed that I found out why. He said he had been flying Air Canada for 22 years and had never had that little leg room. After we were in the air I pulled out the laptop case from under my feet and found out I did not have enough room to open it. I slid it into the aisle to open was told not to do that but got the laptop out. I pulled out my tray put the laptop on it opened the laptop to find out there wasn't enough room to open the screen high enough to view it. I am a thin woman so I pulled the tray into my chest and the laptop closer too. That worked and I watched a movie the whole flight. Every time somebody went down the aisle they hit my seat which jabbed the laptop into my chest a bit more.

LHR-FRA in Club Europe. First part is not really a review more a rant. I travel a lot for work and always try to fly BA whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a Gold card So for our annual vacation I was looking forward to hopefully getting us all (wife plus 9 year old daughter) into the First Class lounge at LHR as a nice start to our holidays sadly the staff member on the door said no. - yes I know you can only normally sign in 1 guest but for my other 50+ flights a year I never sign in anyone! Still no joy-computer said no. So I asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively 'that is not protocol'. We walked away having been made to feel like naughty kids. Rest of the trip was fine-In fact I would go as far as to say the flight was excellent-really friendly cabin crew who made us feel welcome and gave us a good start to the holidays.

Apart from the fact that i had to pay for one of my check in baggags twice cause i travel with a guitar and they are strict about their oversize policies (beware guitarists Ryanair is the only airline that is so strict and petty for that matter about oversize luggage - okay it is the policy, granted, but when the flight turns out to be chaotic, overcrowded, staff must be overworked or dissatisfied in general, because a smile is the last thing you are greeted with, and the flight turns out to be so full that your hand luggage ends up being checked in at the gate. You get the feeling like they are strict only about matters that are in Ryanair's interest, such as those that translate into revenues, because the oversize fee wasn't exactly ""lowcost"" - it was almost the same price as the flight. All luggage costs in total were the same as what I paid for the flight, so i paid double. So much for lowcost. I felt ripped off and also felt the underlying greedy vibe of a company that only uses the ""lowcost"" label as a means to market and boost their brand. The only thing low about this company is friendliness, legroom. Also seems like it targets business people with briefcases, or it sets out to favour these, rather than guitarists, surfers etc travelling the world. Wont be fooled by their flashing marketing campaigns with apparently low prices again.",Detractor
"  Dubai to Kathmandu. Horrible airline, this was the worst flight of my life. It was so hot in my seat that I thought I would pass out. Not only was there no air coming from the vents, my â€œtvâ€ that didn't work was overheating, creating more unbearable heat. To top it all off they didn't have half their menu and the bathrooms were the dirtiest I have ever seen on a flight. These horrendous conditions got me sick, do yourself a favor and fly with another airline.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines flight from Gatwick was delayed with 30mins on the screen. We were all ready to depart, but they kept us waiting for another 1h 30mins without any explanation. I had that time for my connection so I started to feel that will lose it as I know how chaotic is Istanbul Ataturk airport (least passanger friendly). We just arrived 30mins before my departure to Bangkok, with another 25 passengers for the same flight to BKK. A guy was waiting for us at the entrance and guide us to our gate which was very helpful and made us think that we will actually catch the flight. We all arrived 10 mins before departure, but they close the gates and didn't let us on, the most annoying thing that without any explanation we could even see that they let PAX board before us. So dissapointing, staff does not speak English and not helpful at all. They guide us to the ""care desk"" with the grumpiest stuff ever (I understand that they need to deal with angry and dissappointed passangers all day, but they behaviour was unacceptable). I gave my boarding card to the lady in same time as my flight was departing.. She just printed me another ticket for the next flight 5 hours later. No appologies no nothing. I like Turkish Airlines for their food and new planes (not the A340), and very reasonable price, and have flown Turkish Airlines for a long haul many times, but will never do it again.",Detractor
"We flew FD2603 DMK-CSX on 16/09/14 and returned by FD FD2604 on 19/03/14. The DMK-CSX boarding was delayed because staff were not at the gate at departure time. We were informed that they had been busy with another gate and thus no staff were available for our gate. The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new. BTW the inflight services are OK on both legs. Web-ordered meals were reasonable. Finally when we arrived at DMK three of our luggage had lost the luggage tags. Fortunately there was not much baggage and we could identify them. But imagine if this were a connecting flight or several pieces of baggage was involved?",Passive
" Dallas Ft Worth to Ho Chi Minh City via Seoul. This is the first time I fly Korean air and all of their four legs was delayed. Pretty lousy statistics, I should say. It certainly doesn't help when your flights are so long and you want to just get through it as quickly as possible. On top of that I was placed in the last row by the bathroom for the nearly 20 hrs flight home. Fortunately I was able to change the seats by going to the airport ticket counter the night before. For the 15 hrs flight from TX to Seoul, only two meals were served. Boy! I was very hungry so on my return flight I packed extra food. Suffice to say future flying with Korean Air will be rather unlikely.",Detractor
"  Auckland to Melbourne. Check In was done very efficiently, I was even given my boarding pass for my onward flight to Perth and after security and passport control, I headed off to the Lounge to enjoy breakfast. Once boarding began, I was greeted by the Cabin Crew who seemed to be more personal and genuinely care compared to my last few flights with Qantas. Once airborne, the inflight service began with breakfast (my second Breakfast) and to be honest it was one of the worst meals to date, as everything tasted dry and overcooked. I've started noticing that the IFE has less or more content depending on the route being served, and as a frequent flyer and a loyal customer I do think more is better. The Cabin Crew were the highlight of the flight, very attentive and present during the journey. Coming into Melbourne was the roughest landing I have experienced.",Passive
"â Unverified | Portland to New York JFK via Seattle. We showed up at Portland Airport for an 8pm flight. Our gate was switched twice, a sign of what was to come. As was the hard of hearing old man that the gate staff refused to help. The 8pm flight was delayed so badly that it became clear that we would miss our connection in Seattle. The bumbling idiots at the ticket counter couldn't figure out a solution to this issue, since their system doesn't link with better airlines (such as Jetblue). They put us up in a hotel for the night with the promise of a non-stop first class, 6:15am flight (to Newark, when our car was at JFK). Midway through the flight, we are diverted to Pittsburg, where we were trapped on the plane for 3 hours. After an announcement that we were going to Baltimore next, we took off for Newark, landing at 7:30pm . From 6:15am to 7:30, we were offered one fruit plate and some small snacks. We had to take a cab home. The next morning, we took a two buses and a train to our car at JFK .

" Lisbon to Luton. This was my first time using EasyJet. I was surprised how many people try to carry on huge bags. This meant that staff were taking bags from people to put them in the hold whilst they were queuing to get on the plane. Unfortunately this meant a two tier system as some were lucky and got away with huge bags whilst others were not. The staff were firm but also rude and insisted one lady exited the queue to go and pay for her luggage to be placed in the hold. EasyJet should make it clear that all bags larger than the size listed in their website will be placed in the hold and charged for and this should be enforced at check in, not afterwards. Our flight was delayed by around 2.5 hours. Anxious not to pay each traveller the Â£3 we were entitled to we were boarded into a priority access area. Queued to go through an electronic passport check only to have queue to have them checked again before boarding. Once on board we err asked to sit quickly to avoid losing the take off slot. Then a staff member demanded boarding passes from some passengers. She was rude and abrupt with them and offered no explanation for her demand despite the passenger being very pleasant with her. The delay meant we were travelling at dinner time and the food options are very basic. Due to the quick changeover the choices were further reduced as they quickly ran out of some selections. Food is poor. I was in row 8. I got the last ham and cheese sandwich. It was really dry. Pretty gross really even for airline food. My husband opted for a bacon baguette. Strangely the bacon was just about cooked but the baguette was dry. He had to ask for the ketchup it was supposed to come with and was given one sachet despite the advert offering two sachets. The staff on board were pleasant. The captain needs to check his maths as he was updating with time left on the flight with corresponding times that simply did not add up! EasyJet is a budget airline but can do better with minimal effort.",Detractor
" San Francisco to Manila via Beijing. You get what you pay for. The fare was the cheapest during the time I booked it, however the overall experience was horrible. On the way to Manila, one of my 2 checked in luggage was lost-and getting a hold of an agent both in airport I arrived and through the phone was a nightmare. Food was subpar (I've had worse) and the bathroom's stink level is variable depending on the time you go there. When I got back to the States (this time via Houston), I was able to pass through the immigration line fast however my bags took a long time to get out of the conveyor belt. When I looked around, it wasn't only be who was in panic mode and kept looking at my watch as most of us had connections to make (mine was to Atlanta via United). I tried talking to the agent in the airport who was near the conveyor belt regarding my situation but to my surprise, she was very rude and told me I have to pay for my fare to Atlanta in case I miss my connection. By then, you can imagine how desperate and tired I was and I was near to tears by then but she simply looked irritated and later on I realized she was displaying that sort of attitude to everyone who was inquiring about the fiasco of delayed bags and connecting flights. Fortunately for me, when I went straight to the United counter, the guy there was very sympathetic and booked me on another flight, same day with no extra charge since I did miss my connecting flight. Now that was what customer services should be. Even if I ended up in the end paying for it (which thank God I did not), treating your customers like dirt when they are dead tired from flying over 12 hours isn't how I think customer service should be, The only good thing about this airline is the cheap price of their tickets-however if your may concern is getting through your trip without fear of losing your luggage or dealing with airline personnel who will be polite and at the very least professional to you-this is not the airline for you. So yeah-if I have a choice I will not fly this airline again unless I want to risk going through these horrible experience again.

"  London - Istanbul - Mashad in August and returned in September in economy. Three of us took the flights, planes were dated but they were clean and entertainment provided on board. Due to code sharing their flights were full to the limit. Lunch and dinner very good, however we did not like the breakfast. Mashhad to Istanbul delayed and as a result of this and due to very unhelpful airport staff (not Turkish Airlines) we missed our connecting flight and had to board the next flight, arriving in London 5 hours later than originally planned. Our bags delayed by about 5 days. All this to the side, Turkish Airlines processed our claim within 7 days, I had to only send a single email and full compensation was paid. Cabin crew were fantastic and ready to help. What I am most impressed with is their claim department that processed our claim very fast and paid full compensation.

London - Cape Town via Doha and Jo'burg on 6th Feb returning on 18th Feb. Outward flight from Doha delayed (awaiting connecting passengers) which meant I missed my connection in Jo'burg. This was on South African but booked as through ticket with Qatar. No-one from Qatar to assist on arrival. SA would not rebook. Had to search airport for Qatar desk (which was in international departures miles away (and well hidden). This was highly stressful after 2 flights. Return trip flight one hour late into Doha. Efficient transit meant I caught the London flight but again one hour late. It seems that the transit for many passengers is leading increasingly to delays. Inflight service ok. 777 comfortable - 340 less so and poorer AVOD. Choice of films etc was excellent. Food tolerable but had the same chicken wrap 3 times and breakfast orange squash described as orange juice was disgusting. 3 flights out of 4 were an hour late. I would probably try to fly direct next time.,Passive
Although it is an improvement that all seats are now allocated it's worth noting that even if you have purchased an allocated a seat up front this does not mean that you have Speedy Boarding. In fact Speedy Boarding now seems pointless since you need to get to the gate amongst the earliest passengers or so they told me at the gate last night. Seems to me that EasyJet should now copy best practice by proper airlines and board by seat number on busier flights. At the moment it is unnecessarily stressful.,Passive

The B77L aircraft had the original two-cabin configuration, with decent entertainment options. Meal choices consisted of Canadian as well as Japanese fare.

Travel twice a year from CDG to VIE. I booked my ticket online in the US. It was not possible to check in online 24 hours prior to the flight and print out a boarding pass. You have to do it at the airport wait until an Austrian airline rep can check you in and get you a boarding pass. This is extremely inconvenient and annoying. Instead of going to the lounge for the layover at 6.30 in the morning arriving from NY you have to wait to get a boarding pass. CDG-VIE business class has the same seats as coach the seat next to you is left empty. The whole point of a business class is have a roomier seat with more legroom.

" We flew from Johannesburg to Athens with a stop over in Rome and back again for the first time with Alitalia in July 2018. This is the worst airline I have traveled with. Going to Europe, we waited 2 hours after take-off for food to be served. The evening meal was meager, the drinks were served after the meal with NO chance of getting a second glass of wine. I felt as though I was in prison! 10 minutes after dinner the lights were switched off and like good children we were put to sleep. No sight of air stewards/stewardesses anywhere - they must have a special hole that they disappear into at night. In the morning a croissant was provided with no chance of a second cup of coffee. The staff were unfriendly in the extreme and I felt that this was the last place they wanted to be. On our return, I noticed that my seat could not recline (this is an overnight flight) and asked one of the staff for help. When he saw that the seat was faulty, he waved me to the back of the plane and told me to sit in the one empty seat next to someone else. He did not escort me there and explain to this stranger why I was going to sit next to them or of my predicament, which I would have thought would be the right way to do this. In the end, I ""slept"" upright. The same type of sub-standard meal was presented as dinner - again no chance to ask for another glass of wine to put myself out of my misery as the air staff bolted away and switched off the lights as soon as they could. One burnt croissant for breakfast later we were back in South Africa and I have never been happier to step off a plane. Awful, awful, awful service.",Detractor
Final sector from Dubai to Melbourne QF 10 Jan 14. We had paid for exit row seats and the extra leg room was most appreciated. I was most unimpressed when we boarded in Dubai (after the London - Dubai leg) to find we were unable to use the overhead lockers which we were compelled to use because the crew had their luggage there. When I questioned why I was told there wasn't where else to put it. As customers who have paid extra for these seats I believe the crew should put their luggage in the hold or in another area in the plane. Crews attitude quite patchy. Breakfast very ordinary.,Passive

"  First, the boarding gate is gate 1 in Hong Kong, which is very close to the exit of the customs. The flight is on time, arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead, the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later, the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box, the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits, orange, kiwi, pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise, salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more, but probably this is an overnight short flight, 3 hours and 40 minutes, departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables. I would be happier if it was a full meal. The inflight entertainment was excellent. It offers a great variety of HK, Asia and western movies, TV programmes and music.

I have flown with Vueling Airlines three times of which the last was a round trip from Barcelona to DÃ¼sseldorf. Both the outbound and the return flights were more than an hour delayed and in the Barcelona Airport they changed the gate in the last moment making it difficult for passengers to know where to go to. It is supposed to be a cheap airline but it cost only a little bit less than it would have with Lufthansa because they make you pay â‚¬25 more if you want to have your baggage checked. They offer customers nothing on flight: no entertainment no snacks - the food they sell is quite bad and really expensive prices for small portions â‚¬6 for a tiny sandwich or â‚¬2.5 for a 15cl soft drink. On my return flight I wanted to purchase something to eat but they had ran out of everything. To be fair the staff on board are nice but the seats are totally uncomfortable. I will never again fly with Vueling. It is false that it's a cheap airline and for a similar price they offer you much better services in other companies.,Detractor

" Newark to Port of Spain. If one's wondering if customer service has died among the US carriers then any flight with United will confirm that sadly it is deep in the grave. If the insults of charging customers for every single small comfort ever conceived in private transport, weren't already enough, the totally apathetic or even hostile attitude of the staff in anything but top tier business class, appears to demand that already deceased customers, rise just to be killed again. Passengers flying United are treated no better than cattle, or more properly cash cows to be milked, and then thrown off the plane. In both of our flights the only time the cabin crew even spoke to customers was to reprimand them or tontry and talk them into checking a bag. Heaven forbid they expend a calorie trying to welcome or make customers fee at home. The boarding process for our int'l flight was a keystone cops disaster which could have easily been avoided with simple crowd management measures. Instead they stuffed an entire four groups into two narrow lines - even though they had four and expected people to trample over each other. The solo cranky ticket taker was snapping at customers telling them to â€œgo here, â€œ then no, there!â€ while a security person randomly deleted bags - by eye to get tagged and taken from customers as they entered the plane - no advisory, explanation, apology, nothing. Not a manager was to be seen during all this and our departure was over an hour late. Horrible experience from start to finish. That will be our very last flight on United ever.",Detractor

My seat (1F) was very comfortable with plenty of leg room. As the Embraer 190 has a 2-2 seat configuration even in business, I had someone seated next to me. After the take-off, a dinner was served even with the short flight time. The appetizer consisted of beetroot and apple salad and smoked trout and was delicious for an airline appetizer. The main course was a chicken salad for which was also really good. The flight arrived on time and parked in the gates A, which is the standard one for KLM Connect. We deplaned via the front door and a bus dropped us at the gates C. The staff were friendly and respectful.",Promoter

 On 19th April I flew Norwegian from Copenhagen to Los Angeles. It was a great flight as I scored three seats to myself so I could sleep most of the flight. The plane was a 787-9 and it was very comfortable. What I appreciated most was the blue tinted windows as the sun was streaming into the window and it was very hot. The flight was 11 hours and I was able to watch three movies for free. There were minimal service announcements during the flight so we could rest. I will fly Norwegian again as they are one of my choices for a low cost carrier. The only problem encountered was I had to do a manual check in as their system had no place for a green card.,Promoter

First and last time flying with LOT. Flight from Chicago to Warsaw was delayed 2 hours. As a result I missed my connecting flight to Moscow. Seats in business class were quite uncomfortable no electric outlets and the inflight entertainment was pathetic. Transfer desk in Warsaw was a nightmare: one person trying to rebook dozens. Little did I know that my return flight would be even worse: flight from Warsaw to Chicago was delayed 3 hours and then cancelled. Had to get luggage back (waited an hour for that) go back through customs passport control etc. then pushed from one line to next - no clear instructions no help no information. Eventually rebooked to the flight to Toronto. Seats on that flight were also even more uncomfortable than on the first flight and the seat controls were simply not working. We had to spend the night in Toronto and fly to Chicago the next day. As far as travelling in business class and flying in general this was the worst experience ever.,Detractor

The staff were dreadful, when pressing the staff requirement button no-one came, you had to actually go to the back of the plane and interrupt their mothers meeting to which they were extreamly rude about. They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen. Both times we let the staff know to which they didn't do much about or even seem to care. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with.",Detractor

Traveled between SIN-NYC via PVG (RT) on economy. SIN-PVG-SIN flights were old and had no in-flight entertainment but PVG-NYC-PVG are modern (777-300) and had good movie selection however they do not turn it on until an hour after take-off and turn it off 30 min-45 min before landing. Staff barely speaks English and sometimes act rude (specially in SIN-PVG-SIN sectors). Food (including the selection) is very poor and below average in all sectors. Sometimes they only serve Beef or Pork so good luck if you don't eat either. So overall you can survive but this is definitely not ANA or Japan Airlines. I might still fly with them if tickets are really cheap (at least 1/3 cheaper).,Passive

"ORD to ARN on Jan 31. The overall impression was that of a low cost airline that flies old outdated planes. They charge you extra for many things but at the end you get nothing in return. I paid 45 USD to upgrade to a ""preferred"" seat but after boarding I just realized that it was a regular seat at the front of the economy section (row 20) with another seat right in front of me. Service was OK you have to pay for any drinks not ordered with dinner. The entertainment system is outdated all movies start at the same time rather than on-demand. I did pay a relatively low price for the ticket but I would not mind paying the extra 50 to 100 USD and plying with a better airline.",Detractor
"Hong Kong to London with Cathay Pacific, and flying first class is not something I do often, so can only compair to the 4 or 5 times I've flown first class previously. Unfortunately due to a problem with my reservation which I made through BA check in took a long time but was eventually sorted out by the very Cathay Pacific agent at HK central. Due to the delay I had to proceed straight to the gate once I reached HKIA. Boarding was done quickly the aircraft a Boeing 777-300er was spotless, was shown to my seat 1A with drinks and amenities provided. The seat is fantastic with lots of floor and storage space. Meal options/orders taken prior to departure departed on time and once airborne service started quickly. The food and service provided was first class, the crew very experienced chatty and available. I managed to sleep for 4 or 5 hours during the flight using the flat bed seat and a very comfortable duvet. When I was awake I used the Inflight entertainment system which was clear and offered lots of variety. Crew provided snacks and drinks throughout the 12h 20min flight, dinner was offered about 2 hrs out of London and again service and food was extremely good. Flight arrived around 15 min late due to airport delays but once off, bags were waiting and I was out of T3 within 20 mins.

I am still waiting. In my opinion, this company charges just slightly less for flights than the national airlines because they do not spend money on customer services. I reckon customers' emails are never read and they only have one person answering the telephone as I waited 40 minutes before my call was connected to a member of staff.

Flight EY11 18 February. This was the fourth leg of a holiday each flight with its own problems Etihad are getting worse every time I fly with them. This left late as almost every flight does now (previously causing a loss of connection) on this particular leg I was the fifth person asked what I wanted from the menu only to be told that out of three choices this was not available. The entertainment gets less and less and the music selection is non existent consisting mainly of a few compilations. Also they are now trying to avoid giving out fast track cards at London.

Flew round trip from Detroit to Ft. Myers Fl April 12 and April 19th. What happened to Spirit? Last time I flew with this airline was 9 years ago and I did not have 1 complaint but this time? Filthy is the first word that comes to mind. Food on the floors dirty greasy seats and when I told the attendant that the tray table was filthy she handed me a napkin. Before I left I looked in the seat pouch to see if there were any comment cards and found a used vomit bag. Used. Besides the crud the luggage prices are ridiculously high. They charge $45 for a carry-on bag when you use the 24 hour check-in services online ($55 if you check-in at the airport). These are only one-way so for a round-trip flight double those amounts. To choose your seat Spirit will charge you $18 one-way. Double that amount if you want it for a round-trip vacation. So if you would like to sit next to your friend spouse children parents etc. then it will cost you nearly $40 extra. I would never fly Spirit again.,Detractor

"  Used Aeroplan points for 4 in Premium Rouge from Toronto to Honolulu. The 767 was actually recently transferred from ""mainline"" to Rouge so was quite new in the sense that it had been completely redone inside so was very fresh.

FA's came through on a regular basis to offer water. Seats are ok as well, slightly larger and more legroom but obviously not a true business class or lie flat seat. Ipads in Premium Rouge have additional content but bring your own stuff if you really want to be sure you'll have something to watch. I have little patience for people who complain about not knowing their filght is on Rouge when they book it as Air Canada is extremely clear about it when booking and certainly on the ticket. Yes the seats are close together, you have to pay for everything, you need to bring your own ipad and connect to their app before takeoff, but it's all very clear upfront. If you don't like it and didn't pay less than a competitor then book with another airline and take a connecting flight - Rouge will still likely save you a connection.

Amman to Amsterdam Jan 2012. Flight should have taken 5 hrs - took over 17 hrs. Firstly 2 hour delay in Amman due to fog - no explanation given until we were in the air and no drinks given. We tried to land in Amsterdam at midday but due to high winds we diverted to Hamburg. In Hamburg we were not allowed to leave the plane or get any food or drink. Eventually got off the plane - immigration were unaware of who we were and a further delay was caused here. Before we left the plane the crew told all passengers that a representative from the airline would meet us in Hamburg - nobody met us and nobody knew where to go. We were told food and drink would be available for the passengers - this did not happen and each passenger had to pay for their own food and drink. We eventually left Hamburg after searching for the bus and arrived in Schiphol Airport Amsterdam after midnight All in all a terrible experience that I never want to repeat.,Detractor
" Spirit appears to be cheaper, but once you add the fees for each seat, each bag (including carry on), water, snacks, and checking in at the desk, it is just not worth it! I recently flew Spirit for the first time. I sweated and rushed and weighed my bags to make sure they were under 50 lbs. - the industry standard for checked bags. I get to the airport and use the desk to check in. There I am told that Spirit bags must be under 40 lbs! And I was asked if I wanted to continue. Uh, yeah. I was kind of stuck at that point, since my Uber had left. What was I going to do? Throw some of my clothes in the trash? So, yes, I had already paid $60 for one bag, then I had to pay $100 for the second bag and because they were over 40 lbs, I had to pay another $55. Once on the plane, with teensy weensy leg room (I could have paid more for bigger seats, I know, but I went for the cheapest seats), I was charged $10 for water and a snack. On the way home, the man at the check in desk was rude. On the flight, a flight attendant kept banging into my arm, and it was very, very difficult to reach anyone by phone at Spirit. They have no customer service selection option. I had to pretend I wanted to book another flight in order to reach another rude human being. Both rude people attempted to claim that Spirit's bag prices are easy to find on their website. They are not. The carry-on size for Spirit is also smaller than industry standard. Here's a great idea: warn people by email, especially first time travelers with your airline. I would so much rather fly Delta. I don't care if I have to pay $100 more, at least I know I will have great service and comfortable seats and wow - free water!",Detractor

Although the crew was struggling with a broken bathroom light, a slow coffee-machine and a new layout in the galley, dinner was served shortly after take-off. I had the chicken and vegetables ""Mott 32"" signature dish and was not disappointed at all. Actually it has been one of the best inflight-meals since a long time. In general the quality of food out of Hong Kong seemed to have improved. The aircraft itself is very quiet, I hardly noticed it taking off from the runway. My seat was just next to the toilet and behind the galley but thanks to the noise-surpressing headphones I could not hear a thing and managed to sleep through the night just before breakfast service started. But the highlight on the A350 is its inflight-entertainment system, especially the various flight tracking maps (with view into the cockpit, side-views etc.) and the possibilty to switch on the two cameras (front and on top of the aircraft) simultanousely.

I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.,Passive

"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good.

It's an incosistent product, as on the outbound flight there was service, on the inbound flight no service. They should decide, if they are a full-service airline or low cost. I understand that they are under pressure, but they are usually more expensive than Lufthansa and a completely different story, if compared to easyjet. Easyjet is not offering any great service, but you wouldn't expect it. With BA prices are like full-service, but value for money is much worse than easyjet or Eurowings.",Passive

"Flew Toronto to Phoenix, AZ. While the seats were very tight with hardly any leg room, my biggest disappointment was with the baggage. I purposely packed carry-on so I could avoid checking a bag. However when we got to the gate, they asked people to check bags as it was a full flight and ensured us that we would get them off first (along with getting seated prior to economy boarding). Those of us checking our bags were told to leave them in the 'tunnel' just before getting on the plane. When we arrived in Phoenix, none of the bags that were checked last minute made it onto the plane. The Air Canada agent that was at the baggage claim in Phoenix was very inconsiderate and repeatedly told us to wait (even though we had all been waiting over an hour at this point). We all filled out forms for our bags to be delivered to our destinations. Very disappointed with Air Canada rouge.",Detractor
BA92 4/10/14 YYZ-LHR B787 G-ZBJE. If you want to know what Ryanair long haul will be like sit in E on the BA 787. Appalling legroom seat width and non functioning IFE. Gold Card holder flying around 200 trips a year. Absolutely horrendous experience good luck to anyone taking the 12hr+ trip to Chengdu on it! New plane with the smallest seats ever. Many passengers tried to stand the entire trip to avoid the discomfort! If you are anything more than a medium build and have a bum and hips you will have a very uncomfortable flight. I am not one to moan but this is the end for me BA!,Detractor
We took four long haul flights with Singapore Airlines in June and July and were frankly disappointed. On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. Meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow so it can be done!,Detractor
" Pereira to Bucaramanga via Bogota. We were advised 24 hrs before departure that the original flight from Pereira to Bogota was cancelled for no reason. We were re-scheduled to leave four hours before. The first leg of the trip was late for no reason. The second leg of the trip was three hours late. This simple trip took 7 hours more than it should have taken. We never received explanation, a word of excuse, an extra service nor anything that would explain such changes in schedule or delays. Fly with Avianca if you must, otherwise avoid it if possible.",Detractor
"Outbound flight with British Airways from Gatwick to Orlando was good, chose seats at the back of the aircraft and ended up with 9 seats (3 rows) between five of us, so we could stretch out and relax. Food was surprisingly good, served chicken curry with basmati rice for lunch and a chicken caesar salad sandwich for afternoon tea. Plenty of choice of drinks and snacks available throughout the flight in the rear galley. Inbound flight was less good. Took the cabin crew over three hours to do the drinks and dinner service, leaving less than 3 hours to get some sleep prior to breakfast being served. My son's children's meal took nearly two hours to arrive by which time he was starving. Dinner was chicken with dumplings which tasted a lot better than it looked. Breakfast was very poor, a small croissant with jam and a granola bar. The crew seemed stressed and disorganised for the entire flight. The AVOD system is starting to look dated compared with other carriers, there are a limited number of programmes to watch and the audio selection is very small. BA need to look at upgrading this in line with some of the Asian carriers who are miles ahead in this respect. Seats were comfortable and legroom good. Overall I would fly BA again but they could certainly improve some aspects of their service.",Passive
"Did a multicity itinerary with Air India (CCU-FCO, CDG-DEL) and experience was mixed. Call Centre: My interaction with the call centre was actually very good. We had to reschedule our flight from Kolkata to Delhi and it was done for free by calling the call centre. The call centre staff were extremely helpful and efficient. The process was quick and hassle free. Airport Staff are quite friendly. Check in process was smooth enough. Ground staff at Delhi airport were quite helpful in aiding the international transfer. The aircraft itself has to improve. There were some shabby patchworks (especially seat upholstry and remote of the entertainment system). The international flight was a wee bit better than the domestic flight, though not great. Cabin Crew were friendly, though a bit cold in their demeanour. Their response time can improve. However the worst experience of this entire trip was on our flight from Paris to Delhi, there seemed to be a shortage of water on board. The crew served half filled glasses everytime a passenger asked for water. This was completely unacceptable. The food was above average. Nothing to write home about. All our flights actually ran on time. Overall the experience was above average.",Promoter
"Flew from Montreal to Athens. I've traveled on Air Canada Rouge before in Economy class and it was not the best, mostly because of the small legroom. I had a booking on standby for Preminum Economy and I got a seat in economy class because the Preminum cabin was full. I was happy with the seat I got because it was a bulkhead so there was plenty of legroom. On the return leg I got a Premium seat which was very comfortable but not so much for sleep. The meals were complementary and were very good. The crew and the service on board was also good. The crew were passing often to offer drinks during the whole flight in the Premium cabin. The inflight entertainment was on a tablet provided the in Premium class otherwise it's on your own smartphone or tablet with the App. The App worked well as I had use it on a previous trip. There was also a pillow and a blanket provied for each passenger for the flights. Another downside is that there's no charging ports on board. Overall Air Canada rouge has the same level of service with the mainline but not the same level of legroom in Economy class. It's better to choose a different airline with a connecting flight for the same price, based on the legroom. However the Economy Premium product is very good and if I could afford it I would travel again in that cabin more often.",Passive
Flights from Heathrow to Zurich and on to Newark 0333 and 0018. Problems boarding a to Heathrow and 45 minutes late departing. With a 40 minute connection at Zurich could have been a problem but not for Swiss. Picked up 25 minutes on the flight and met at gate driven across to next flight and seated with 10 minutes to spare. On both flights delightful crews excellent service food and seats and I like their lie flat bed. Recommend Swiss and find Zurich a great connection point.

LAS-SFO B737-900 and SFO-SYD B777-200. First leg was a short flight on a new plane soft drinks served courteous crew seats were just average but still too short flight to complaint. Second leg killer flight to Australia almost 15 hrs upgraded to Economy plus which was disappointing because basically is the same as economy with just a wider seat pitch that gave me more leg room and a comfortable sleep. Food just fine the trays are getting smaller and smaller crew was nice and attentive plane a bit old IFE average small screens with a good selection. I have no problems flying UA again but it has to be a really good deal as it is oceans apart compared to Qantas or Air New Zealand on the same routes down under.,Passive

Heathrow-Singapore-Auckland return Nov/Dec 2014. All four sectors were on the A380 and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline. Highly recommended.,Promoter
"  Singapore to Zurich in May 2013. In April, to my knowledge, SQ 346 is very often packed and seat reservation might be difficult if you are two but on a different booking. On this particular flight I took a so called P seat which is next to the exit. Actually there is a lot of legroom left on the other side of the metal, there's permanently cold air coming up from the door. As often for a early morning flight 01.20am people are some of harshly due to sleep shortness. The cabin crew is very patient even if some become aggressive sometimes.",Promoter
"  Tokyo Haneda to New York JFK. As Senator member of Lufthansa I was choosing ANA because of its Star Alliance membership. Overall the experience was rather good. ANA flies an up to date aircraft to New York with the configuration of business class that gives every passanger an isle access, a small table with storing facilities as well as a full flat bed with pillow and cover. The privacy is quite good above all if you choose a window seat with the table towards the aisle. The seat functionality is simple and the comfort pretty good even if the cushions are a bit hard. Food on board is good and the servings are just right so that you don't feel overly stuffed. Wine selections are good as well. On the downside the entertainment program which is extremely limited and not varied enough for non Asian costumers. The service onboard is very good in a japanese style. The flight attendants (almost always women) are very kind and attentive and tend to your every need. I would definitely chose ANA again as it is a much more comfortable option to fly from Japan to the US, although it is also more expensive than the american carriers.",Promoter
"We usually use Thai Airways for our travels because of their previously friendly and patient service. An argument not to be underestimated when traveling with toddlers. However, for our round trip this time, staff were just below all expectations. Instead of water they came around 3 times with wine. We had to wait 1 hour at Munich airport in the airplane because some passengers (Thai Military apparently) came late for unknown reasons with filled shopping bags. No excuses or explanation from staff. Upon our enquiry we were just told ""We are tired, too."" Entertainment program was not turned on - of course - during the waiting time. Even with a brand new A380, the computer had to be started over and over again until it finally worked. This does not inspire confidence into the board computer for the pilots. To be mentioned that tickets for Thai are not cheap. Overall a lousy experience and we will avoid Thai for next trips.",Detractor

"I recently travelled on AC from Vancouver to Heathrow and back. I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said ""I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good. Their business upgrades are typically $500.",Passive
"Flight from ORD to Edinburgh was first delayed and then cancelled at 7pm due to ""aircraft maintenance"". We were told to stay at the gate where a 'recover' team would rebook us onto other flights. It took each agent about 15 minutes to deal with each customer and then after standing in line for an hour we were told that we had to leave the gate as it was needed for another flight. We were told to go and join the back of the long queue at the Customer Services desk across the hall. After standing in line for almost another hour we were told that the best that could be done would be to put us on the flight the next day.

"  Again a wonderful flight with Etihad from Hyderabad to New York via Abu Dhabi. It is our third time with them. The primary consideration is fare and convenience, and Etihad checked the boxes again. The flight itself was very comfortable, on time, but it was the staff and service that makes them our favorites. The small but useful convenience kit even in economy is a nice touch. The seats were standard, the entertainment more than adequate and the food average. Slept 8 hours in the 13 hour flight. Comfortable blankets and the head support on the seat is a nice thing to have. Check in was smooth, baggage arrived intact, connection was a breeze, and the US pre-clearance meant that exit at JFK was easy. One thing to keep in mind is the 45 minute to 1 hour wait for the pre-clearance for US flights. Will fly them again in a heartbeat.",Promoter
"  Flew from Rome Ciampino to Lisbon. Time is one of the most important factors when I travel and I have targets to achieve and I am pleased to say that Ryanair played a relevant role to allow me to be efficient. Arriving around 25 minutes ahead the schedule gave me the chance to do what I was supposed to do earlier and it definetely simplified my day program and also gave me some (extra) free time. If I have to choose between paying more for additional service or to receive a smart, no frills service, I have no doubts: Ryanair will be my choice. When I booked this flight (4 days before departure) a direct flight (with more or less the same schedule) from another airline was about three times the price. The fare was not a ""low-cost"" fare but it was the cheapest and most competitive one. Arrival ahead schedule, very positive overall impression.",Promoter

"  Flew Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai. Emirates is one of the few remaining airlines that offers a differential in Economy class. I love other airlines in Premium, Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product, the seat is comfortable, there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good, I like being provided with a menu prior to service, a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only (personal) regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK (I do this route frequently).

"Some snow in Istanbul the day before my flight completely overwhelmed Istanbul airport and Turkish Airlines. My flight was 4 hours late out of Berlin. The bus in IST took another 15 minutes to leave the plane and my connecting flight to Johannesburg was nowhere signposted, and no ground staff around that could be asked. Maybe that was just bad luck, but than the nightmare (3 am) began. There was a queue of hundreds of people in front of a transfer desk which did not move at all! There seemed to be quite some ground staff behind the counter, but it was not clear what they did except walking back and forth ignoring passengers' pleads. Children were sleeping on the floor next to the line. After three hours I left my travel companion in the line and walked the airport to find another less crowded travel desk. Here ground staff was also walking away from exhausted passengers and their questions. Ground staff sent passengers to the other transfer desk to get rid of them. I persisted and finally got a boarding pass for a day later. No offer of food, accommodation or anything (7 am). The flight the following day was again 3 hours late and did not make up for the disaster. Filthy seat, uninterested crew and poor food. I don't support reviewers opinion on food.

Osaka to Helsinki - the flight was overbooked and I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to business class. I would not be able to afford it normally so I was delighted! The highlight was the seat itself and the sense of personal space it created. The crew were attentive and courteous and seemed to respond promptly when I saw other passengers using their call buttons. It feels bad to complain about anything when I was getting a free upgrade but in the interests of objectivity and honest feedback I would have to say that the food was surprisingly bad. If I had paid full fair I would have felt very let down. The menu looked promising but the dishes did not fulfil that promise. The Japanese options looked better than the more European ones I chose: pasta so overcooked it was to hard to chew tough dry meat overheated rice welded to the dish minimal salad general blandness unappetising presentation.

"  Belfast to Seoul via London Heathrow. Pretty poor. Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was ok, nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name. Friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. Flew the same route with Qatar Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. I am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit, like most people.

Top-notch service from this crew as they were able to get for you what you needed. The seat was relatively comfortable and the inflight entertainment system had plenty of good choices. No fuss boarding at both CDG and YYZ, and their mobile boarding pass was a huge time saver at busy airports such as CDG. If there was one thing I didn't like it would be their in-flight catering - strange choice of mains such as shredded carrots on pasta was not very delicious, and they ran out of second options on both flights. However, pre-landing snacks were delicious and the wine selection was excellent. Look forward to flying them again in future and hopefully by then they will change their menu.",Promoter

This product far exceeds what you get on United, Lufthansa, and Air France to Europe out of SFO and tends to sell at about 40% less money than these other carriers. My only complaints is that drink service tends to be a bit neglected (e.g., if you want a second glass of wine you are going to have to ask for it, no one will offer). That's not much of a problem.",Promoter

"Milan to Cape Town via Doha return on Qatar Airways. MXP-DOH in a cramped A330, flight on time, nice Japanese crew and average food. DOH-CPT on the Boeing 787, a narrow seat but not as cramped as described in this forum. Cabin crew spent a lot of the night time in the rear of the aircraft talking. CPT-DOH with a very fast check in. Final sector of DOH-MXP on an A330 with average seat pitch. Very nice and helpful crew and average food. Good service, and for all the flights departure perfectly in time. All in all a good experience, but a five star airline should not have cramped aircraft for a 9 hours flight.",Passive
"Vancouver to Perth via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific. Full flight on both legs. Modern planes on both legs. Crew very good on first flight, on second seemed like they were in training and very slow service. Food not great on either flight, snack box breakfast before arrival in Perth a selection of very sugary snacks, no hot option although not surprising on a 7 hr 30 min flight. Both flights delayed, first due to late arrival of flight from Hong Kong with no obvious reason. Second due to longer route due to volcano on Java which is not the fault of the airline. Overall generally comfortable planes and good crew especially one lady on the Vancouver to Hong Kong leg who was extremely friendly and efficient. Otherwise quite an average experience.",Passive

This was a 4-hour flight (scheduled to depart at 2240 hrs and arrive at 0230 hrs) however, the cabin lights were only slightly dimmed throughout the flight and it was difficult to get some sleep. Air conditioning was very weak for most of the flight and seats are not comfortable.",Detractor
Regularly fly from AMS to KRK via Warsaw. All in all basic experience seats are very cramped and padding is non existent but does not seem to be notably different from LCCs. Catering is alright just a snack on these flight nowadays. The most appalling thing is staff service as long as you don not ask anything or no flights are canceled delayed etc. Lot seems to work fine. Lately I had a few cancellations and that is the moment when staff get nasty and rude. They never seem to manage these kind of situations appropriately and will always try the passenger to blame for the airline's cancellations and delays etc and will never acknowledge their own mistakes. When they notice the blaming passenger strategy does not work they will always try the I do not understand / speak English excuse and send you from counter to counter and you are left on your own. So frustrating!,Detractor
"Flew out to Sydney from Heathrow on the 14th May and back on the 9th June. A380 for two of the four legs, (should have been 3 legs but Etihad changed the AH to LHR plane after we'd booked). Heathrow and Sydney lounges good, Abu Dhabi large and lacks sufficient showers. Food at Sydney was excellent, (first time that we've eaten in the lounge), but elsewhere was only adequate.

Why do they insist on lengthy announcements during the sleep sectors? Generally FAs were less than friendly and efficient.",Passive
SFO-NRT NRT-MNL. Check-in at SFO was efficient and friendly which was a good start for the trip. Service on board was efficient friendly and warm. This is perhaps ANA's strong suit although it may just be a cultural thing for Japan but the cabin crew were beyond amazing. Every service call was answered and every request was honored. Their professionalism is excellent and each interaction was followed by a bow and a thank you even though they are the one doing you a favor. However the IFE seat comfort and food was average. 77W was configured as 3x4x3 however legroom was still excellent. IFE was disappointing and the choices of movies were just poor. However the moving map was of high quality. NRT-MNL leg on an older 767 but the seats were still comfortable and service was once again excellent. Overall. a very pleasant experience with ANA. While their hard product is average their service is what sets them apart. The crew are warm and friendly which many other highly rated airlines like Singapore lacks.,Promoter

Flew economy from Honolulu to Sydney during the day. All was reasonable excepting the entertainment that I was looking forward to to pass the time of day away. Adult movie selection was 4 B grade movies. The ipads froze for 10 seconds every 3 minutes. The sound was not audible through the earphones.

I regularly fly London Heathrow to Bangkok and have always used British Airways until this latest trip due to a ridiculous and inexplicable rise in fares at BA. Staff are extremely professional whilst being friendly and are helpful if required.

She did not greet me and just shouted â€œyour boarding ticket!â€ What kind of friendliness is that? Also, the day I arrived I did not know where to go so I asked for help. Both the ladies standing checking the boarding tickets refused to acknowledge me saying â€œexcuse meâ€ (trying to get their attention) and kept on talking instead. When they finally decided to answer me they gave me the wrong instructions (yes I got even more lost instead) it was just a way for them to get rid of me.

" Sydney to Phuket via Hong Kong. As others have said in recent times, I don't believe Cathay deserve their 5-star rating anymore. I have a long history of flying Cathay, going back to 1979, on one of their final B707 flights into SYD. This trip was very, very ordinary to say the least. Firstly, I chose the flights I did, so as not to fly with their 10-abreast B777ERs. So, all 4 sectors were flown with A330s, 2 with mainline, 2 with Dragon. Much more comfortable. I found the cabin crews were still excellent. The problems come from what they are given to work with and offer passengers. Just off the top of my head, in addition to the race-to-the-bottom that are the 10-across B777 configurations, in the past 10 months since my last trip, the following have gone from Y-class service: amenity kits, refresher towels before takeoff, juice or water prior to take off, deserts on the meal trays (the ice creams which are now the dessert, had always been an â€œextraâ€). Until now, I'd go out of my way to fly with CX. No longer. I'll use them if it makes geographical sense to do so, like Aust - Europe and that, mainly due to the Marco Polo club benefits. But no longer, say, for Aust - N.America, as I quite often gladly did in the past. All very sad! I hope that management eventually realises that you don't regain profitability by cutting and cutting relentlessly, and becoming â€œjust another ok airlineâ€.",Passive

A good option for beverage, even beer, whisky and other alcoholic beverage but the food is horrible, some peanuts and thats all.

"  Today's trip was a one-day return without any checked-in luggage flying from Amsterdam to Nantes. This trip was booked on the Air France website, however the outbound flight from Amsterdam to Nantes was operated by HOP!, a regional subsidiary from Air France. Since HOP! offers a basic, no frills service, neither in Amsterdam nor in Nantes I could use the Skypriority facilities, even though I have Flying Blue Elite Plus status. In fact this was not a big deal, Nantes Maritime Airport is very compact with virtually no lines for security and immigration. On both flights I could book myself on the Emergency exit rows with excellent leg space at no charge. Check in was done via the Air France App which is very user friendly. Both flights were the typical Air France short haul service, in the HOP! flight it was a coffee and a cookie (and a great smile!) and on the return AF Flight the service consisted of a pre-packed sandwich and a coffee, all totally fine for a 70min. flight. On both flights, which left and arrived in time and the service was friendly and personal. The only minus this day was that upon arrival in Nantes we had to wait about 15 minutes before a bus arrived to bring us from the remote stand to the terminalbuilding.",Passive
"Check in at Gatwick was quick and was advised that flight to Istanbul was on time. By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay. Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat. What was especially good was the standard of catering and the fact the the meal was served so quickly. It is a pity that what is essentially a good product at a very attractive price is so let down by such chaos when things start to go wrong.",Detractor

The business class offering from Cathay Pacific is superb. At HK airport I got access to several lounges spread through the airport. My favourite being The Wing. The flight itself was excellent. Extremely courteous and efficient FAs. I think that the business class seats in Cathay are as good as some first class seats on some airlines. The seat fully reclined to a flat bed with ample space to stretch. Im 5'7"" by the way. The 1-2-1 configuration means all seats get aisle access and you don't feel claustrophobic, which you do on some of the other airlines that have a 2-2-2 configuration. All in all a great flight.

" As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service. This is not a problem in Europe where you are treated as a human being. Not in America - there, you are just a member of a crowd they have to control.",Detractor

United did not help with any accommodation for a place to sleep in the night for any of their customers. When I checked into a hotel that I was forced to pay for, other people staying at the hotel had vouchers from the Amarican Airlines company because American Airlines cares about where their customers go to sleep at night in the event of a flight change or delay.

" Flew KLM from Madrid to Oslo via Amsterdam. It is always nice to fly a new B-737-800. The Boarding was fluent and on time. The aircraft was very clean, both outside and inside. Nice and warm welcome when entering the plane. Lots of space for my carry on. Reasonable legroom. Power sockets in every seat. Free in-flight snacks and beverages to all passengers. The KLM Crews were very professional and groomed on both flights. The Captain gave a Dutch and English comfort message. One of the flight attendants gave a nice Spanish message. I felt I had pleasant and safe flights.",Promoter
" Cairo to San Francisco with a connection in Istanbul. The flight from Cairo was delayed, which made us too late to make the connection in Istanbul. The worst part is that in Istanbul, they put the arriving on a passengers on a slow bus instead of a tarmac to reach the gate and makes it easy to miss the connecting flights. After missing the connection, we had to spend about another 90 minutes at the customer service desk to get on the flight the next day. Turkish Airlines did pay for the hotel stay as well as dinner and breakfast, but it was still an inconvenience. Then, on the flight the next day, there was yet another delay due to mechanical errors. Unbelievable how unpleasant this flight was.",Detractor
Two trips - LHR-HKG-ICN in April return and one way from ICN-LHR in May - all in Business. First return trip was perfect - 10/10. Very comfortable business class seat and bed good food and attentive service. Only improvement could be to the choice of movies. First trip from ICN-LHR was particularly noteworthy as the first leg was 2.5 hours late due to a thunder storm in Seoul - flight landed in HKG 10 mins after CX255 was supposed to leave but Cathay held that flight which was very impressive and lucky. The ground staff were excellent. The ICN-LHR trip in May was not so fortunate. Due to ATC restrictions over China all flights to Europe were subject to creeping delays - i.e. 30 mins at a time. With the exception of our flight all flights boarded and eventually left - some were up to 4 hours delayed. For some reason CX255 was the only flight not called for boarding and eventually after 5am (4h30m after scheduled departure) the board stated it was est at 0900 the reason being the mandatory crew hours had been reached. I suspect the decision to hold our flight was more about aircraft rotation as that particular aircraft sits on the ground at LHR for 12 hours so effectively CX255 withstand a long delay without suffering a knock on impact to Cathay's schedule. Eventually the flight took off at 0945. Whilst I accept the delay itself was not under Cathay's control the decision to withhold CX255 was not communicated and all passengers were made to wait in the terminal through the night without any offer of accommodation. When on board the flight was perfectly comfortable but my previously flawless image of Cathay's service levels is now tainted.,Passive
"  We were scheduled to fly Air Canada Rouge on December 26, 2016 from Toronto to Varadero, Cuba. The flight was to depart at 0800. This flight was delayed until 1050 because there wasn't a pilot to fly the plane. We boarded the plane at 1015 and sat on the plane for about an hour. There was a maintenance problem with this plane that was discovered as it flew into Toronto. We had to get off of the plane and return to the terminal while they got a different plane. We boarded this different plane at 1230. They then had to rearrange the passenger seating to balance the plane, due to the fact that this was a larger plane. We eventually left Toronto at 1355 instead of 0800. These delays caused us to arrive at our hotel in Varadero at 2030 instead of 1430 which ruined the first day of our vacation. The only compensation that Air Canada provided us was that we could use our boarding passes towards a $15 food purchase during the delay. Considering airport prices, I couldn't get a salad and a pop for $15.",Detractor
"It is difficult to find a seat reservation with Saudi Arabian Airlines at least one week before especially at holidays and vacations. Ground staff are the worst. Its rare not to find someone clashing with them every time because they know you don't have another option rather than them. At once the ground service clashed with me because he wasn't able to recognize my e-ticket on his computer system. Although the ticket is created by their system. How come this to be my fault. Most of the time I travel with one shoulder bag to avoid the ground services, I prefer to deal with a screen and software rather than dealing with them.

No individual screens for movies, on the Madrid to JFK flight thy served awful food - they had nuts and chocolate bars that of course you have to pay for.

Good thing I work for a company that is flexible and didn't need to take a vacation day due to this. The first time it happened, I drove overnight to reach my destination in time - American was useless in even trying to look through other airlines. And when I requested a refund I was told I had to go online and request it. What? I'm on the phone with you after waiting over an hour to speak to a human and you can't just put something into the computer to apply a refund for a flight I can't use because of a cancellation outside of my control? Pathetic. This time? Got rebooked for a flight a full day later that was then delayed another 2 hours. Well worth paying an extra $100 to not have to deal with cancellations.",Detractor
I flew in January 2014 to Bangkok from London. It was a faultless flight efficient professional and courteous. Whilst in Thailand I was recalled back to the UK for personal medical reasons. I emailed the Bangkok office together with my medical certificate. Within 24 hours they issued a new ticket for the day I had requested. There was simply a Â£25 admin fee to pay at the airport. When I arrived at the airport I was checked in through business check in and given a seat with extra leg room at the very front of economy.

"  London Heathrow - Bangkok and Hong Kong - London Heathrow via Helsinki, all flights on A350 Business class, all flights on-time. Was very excited to fly Finnair as well as the A350! Experience was mixed, however. The service between London & Helsinki was sub business class standard, despite the same A350 aircraft on the route. There was no amenity or welcome drinks, even the staff seemed less friendly. On outbound flights, decided not to pre-select any meals as I wanted to pick on the day, however on first leg to HEL, only meal option available was pork based, and I do not eat pork. Added with the fact this was a morning flight and BA lounge in Heathrow lacking any decent food also, I actually went hungry for the morning. Luckily the Finnair lounge in Helsinki saved the day, as I was able to have 'breakfast' there. Lounge itself was very pleasant with nice decor and nice pods to sit and relax. Lounge was very busy on outbound, bit quieter on return early morning time. Added bonus was the showers and sauna. Which I had to try out and was rather pleased to have available. Longer HEL-BKK leg was better more business class like service, where I enjoyed a nice meal (had a duck orange pasta, which was superb) and tried to get some sleep for 9am arrival in BKK. Not sure if it was due to timing or the actual seat/flatbed being quite hard or the noisy full business class cabin, was not able to sleep more than an hour. Not sure why even light breakfast option had to be served a full 60 min before landing? Since it took me 5 minutes to finish it. Return flight from Hong Kong, was better and managed 5 hours of sleep. On flight back to London, had this time, pre-selected a kosher meal, which I found rather dull and uninspiring. They even served me in the same box and plastic cutlery it came with. Overall, this is a good hard product in business class, really appreciate the 1-2-1 layout, even with full cabins. IFE system was adequate even if choice was limited. The soft product/customer service and attention to detail could be improved. Would be happy to fly with Finnair again, if they keep the prices competitive, i.e below the mark of Emirates/Qatar/Etihad etc since their overall offering falls short of business class on those airlines.",Passive

Communication with the airline can be a challenge at times. Our return flight was delayed so we missed our connection and had to stay overnight in Guangzhou, where they looked after us well. Cabin staff obliging and English generally fine. Meals quite acceptable - there is a limited choice of wines, white or red - and the bar service is slow - indeed needed to ask.

I flew Qatar last month multiple times DFW-DOH-IKA-DOH-MED JED-DOH-IKA-DOH-DFW. Have to say I agree with one of the previous reviews regarding staff behavior change as soon as they see a business or first class ticket. Had to change my boarding pass in Dallas while staying in the line the staff were really inattentive and not caring. As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area.

I told the FA that she put the drink down and it slid right off the tray. She proceeded to give me a lecture about how there's an indented part of the tray specifically for glasses and that when an airplane is ascending, it is on an angle - talking to me - a seasoned 1K or Global Services flier with United - as if I'm the six-year old.

Upgraded from business to first class I wish they had not. I have a problematic lower back - the First Class suite is very private but the seat gave very little lower back support and for me the business class seat is more comfortable. The staff on board were very attentive and helpful the Chef came and saw I was not interested in the meal options so he offered to make me a Teryiaki Chicken which was delicious although the Pumpkin Soup was lacking in both consistency and taste.

"The Aeroflot business class experience was really good - we were greeted on arrival with a choice of sparkling white wine, orange juice or water, we were given a proper menu for lunch, and were served with a linen tablecloth and napkin. We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide. The downside was that we hadn't been able to select seats in advance, and I noted that the first row of seats was empty and would've preferred to have been seated in a row on my own, where I could get up freely, rather than next to a stranger, whom I had to disturb if I wanted to get up. I wasn't even able to select window seat or aisle seat, which I think is unsatisfactory. Other than this, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing. Apart from not being able to select seats, it was far superior to the KLM business flight that I took on the return flight. Having said that, the staff - though efficient - were rather 'cold' in their manner (never smiled and never exchanged pleasantries), which is a sharp contrast to the KLM staff on the return flight. (But this might reflect Eastern European professional culture - I experienced similar cold, but efficient, professionalism once in a 5 star hotel in Tallin.)

"  Bangkok to Belgrade via Mumbai and Abu Dhabi. I'm a silver frequent flyer of Air Serbia and Etihad Airways. Some weeks ago I bought a ticket from Belgrade to Thailand and back via Etihad. I chose to travel with Etihad. Before I purchased the ticket I've checked with Etihad Airways about having 2 pieces of baggages 23kg each, using lounges on connecting airports and they confirmed all of that. When I bought the ticket I choose type of meals and seats for the flights. During my route out to Thailand everything was as expected without any problems. A few days before I was to fly back I received e-mail from Etihad reminding me about return flight, offering to check-in online and confirming my seats.

The flight was operated by Jet Airways and they refused to check me in without paying extra for excess baggage (200USD) although they are Etihad partner. They didn't provide me seats and food that I had already confirmed in e-mail and was provided on my way to Thailand. Staff was rude. In Mumbai I thought it would be better since there is Etihad Airways staff but they were worse. Not helping with seats nor food, nor being polite. Also I was denied excess to lounge in Mumbai without a reason although I have right and I confirmed that before buying ticket. Finally I thought in Abu Dhabi everything will be resolved but the headquarters are the worst. There was an employee yelling at me for their mistakes! It's been a month and no resolution. They say they will refund me money but it's been a month and they didn't even asked for my bank account number. They replied to me only after I shared my experience online and when I found their CEO's e-mail and included him in correspondence. On every step of my trip there was a problem. My last flight back home was Air Serbia so I was relieved because I am their frequent flyer and that is my national airline, (unfortunately owned by Etihad Airways) but they still have old standards of hospitality and good service - unlike Etihad.

" London to Delhi. Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India).

"Budapest to Newark from Budapest via Munich with Lufthansa. Our flight from Budapest to Munich was quick, we were provided a full lunch and flight attendants were efficient in moving through the cabin quick so that trips to the washrooms would be possible for everyone before descent. The flight from Munich to Newark was on one of Lufthansa's A340-600s (my first time on an A340) which I must say are absolutely stellar even compared to the A330 which has pretty much the same cabin. The fact that all economy class washrooms are on the cargo level of the aircraft make it very easy to get to them even if it's the middle of dinner service. The seats were extremely comfortable and the IFE system packed with good content. The flight attendants were professional and went out of their way to make everyone comfortable. Despite taking off from Munich 50 minutes late due to delayed incoming passengers from other flights the pilots did a good job at making up for time and we arrived almost on time in Newark.

EK20 MAN-DXB overnight on 25-26 April (B777-300ER) connecting with EK863 DXB-MCT on 26 April (A330-200). The chauffeur service arrived promptly at my home and as always was immaculately turned out. Our drive to Manchester was made tedious by heavy Friday traffic but the driver handled everything calmly and with good humour. At the terminal I was checked in swiftly and 20 minutes later was in the Emirates lounge (this included time spent picking up some last-minute purchases). Boarding was on time and the flight left slightly early. After watching a film and enjoying supper I got 4 hours solid sleep waking up about 50 minutes out of Dubai. We landed a few minutes early and it took only 20 minutes including the security check to get to the gate for my connecting flight despite this leaving from Concourse C and the arrival having parked right at the end of Concourse B.

" Chicago to Orlando. Horrible airline and customer service is just as bad. My son was flying by himself, he was at the gate an hour and half early. The plane was boarding and when he got to the gate he was told to move to the side and wait until everyone boards the plane because he will be last to get on. Actual words, â€œ oh no you have to move to the side and wait, you'll be last to get onâ€. He then has to wait another 15 minutes at the gate after everyone has boarded the plane to board the flight. Once he is finally on the plane stewardess removes another passenger out of their seat to make room for my son to have a seat. So not only are you making an experience bad for an unaccompanied minor you have now inconvenienced another passenger. Very rude and very unprofessional.",Detractor

The sectors CAI-BKK-CAI was in an 777-ER. Seat was comfortable food almost similar to BRU-CAI. After a good sleep I wake up and requested breakfast a few minutes later. However the food never made it to my seat. Entertainment was good (or satisfactory) for a night flight but having a good seat rest and sleep was more important. All together satisfied with the flight except the long transit time (5 hrs) on the return flight. The lounges in CAI are not designed to have a rest or to do some work.

Seems 20 minutes after dropping off the rental car we get the delay notice, 1 hour, getting updates but been here for six hours now. We could have stayed in the rental and enjoyed the days, instead we are sitting with about 600 customers. The delay is due to a breakdown with the plane.

Flew LHR-ADD-LLW and had a generally better experience than reviews had led me to expect. Firstly cabin crew are excellent as friendly as BA on a good day although a bit less attentive. The first plane the 767 was as old as 767s tend to be. My IFE wasn't working but it was a night flight and I wasn't fussed. Plane was fine overall had the newer style overhead lockers. ADD was a bit basic. Bizarre duty free mostly very small shops. 3 flights went from the same gate but when they announced over the intercom it was impossible to hear and they seemed to send me to the wrong gate. I was the last person on the flight for the last leg! This was a 737. Brand new seats are more basic than Ryanair but otherwise it came with the interior pack and was pleasant enough for 3 hours. Would be getting tetchy after that though! Food was good throughout.,Promoter

LGW-ACF-LGW (Club Europe) On both flights we had very good cabin staff infact the purser was the same on both flights and he was very efficient and very friendly as were both stewardesses. The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too so I had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.,Promoter
"We flew Turkish Airlines from Malaga to Bangkok return, with a 3 day stay in Istanbul on the way back. Malaga to Istanbul on a new Boeing 737 had seatback TV throughout and coloured cabin lighting. The A330 on the longhaul sector was also new. The crew are not overly smiley but have a certain reassuring quality about them. Catering was plentiful and excellent on all flights with a frequent drinks service. Amenity kits in economy class. Upon checking in in at Bangkok for the return leg, the check-in staff gave us back a make up bag which they had found left behind at our seat on our inbound flight. All flights on time - the scale of their operation from Istanbul is mind blowing. If I have to complain it would be the ground handling in Istanbul - we were a group of 5 and because of a rescheduling, our pre assigned seats had gone. The flight was full and there was absolutely no effort made to seat us together or apology. This is the 2nd long haul I have done with Turkish Airlines and certainly will use them again.",Promoter

" Amsterdam to Venice. You get to know an airline when things go wrong. And wrong it went. Our flight to Venice was okay. Half an hour delay due to the whether, but whisked to Venice with a strong tail wind. Friendly staff, bad legroom but it's low-cost. The way back was a different story. Our flight was cancelled in the last minute because of bad wheater in Amsterdam. It was bad, but why didn't KLM cancel its flight on the same route? Apart from that easyJet managed the situation very well. Off course there was a queue, but within 30 mins I got a message that we had a reservation in a 4 sta rhotel for the night, including transport, diner and breakfast. Since all easyJet flights were full, we chose to fly to DÃ¼sseldorf the next day on Eurowings. I asked for a refund and the next morning it was credited to my card.

I flew one way MCO-LGW 6th October the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations British Airways has lost a customer for life. I requested assistance due to illness which I couldn't have at Orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? When boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because I was young and didn't appear to need assistance. After this I could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if I was ok. The drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. The meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route.

"  For the last two years I have been flying between Chisinau and Stockholm via Kiev with UIA. It was never possible to check in online other than with the assistance of the agent who has been selling me the tickets. As such, it is interesting that for two years Ukrainian Airlines has done nothing to fix the problem. But the worst happened during my latest flight: Chisinau to Stockholm return in October. On the return flight even my agent could not check me in on line for the leg Kiev - Chisinau, and at the airport in Stockholm they could not check me in either for that leg. Worst still, the check-in counter in Stockholm could only check in my suitcase until Kiev, not until Chisinau, which was my final destination. Thus, in Kiev I had to get out of the transit hall, get my suitcase, pass through all the controls again, check in again, all that in one hour and ten minutes. An unforgettable nightmarish experience. The most nightmarish aspect was not so much the stress but the attitudes of Ukrainian staff everywhere, at the security checks, at the passport controls, and, worst of all, at the checking in of the UIA counters. Hostile, misanthropic, sadistic attitudes, totally unfriendly and unhelpful, they even seemed amused by my ordeal. It was like experiencing the Soviet Union anew, where the petty bureaucrat behaves like a small tyrant. For me that was the last straw. I will never fly with UIA again and I will never fly via Kiev again. Enough is enough.",Detractor
SQ912 SIN-MNL 13/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVG. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins. There was a delay in moving off but captain kept passengers well informed. Service was fantastic as usual better than on the return leg since crew were still fresh from rest. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was so-so. Had a choice between braised beef with fried rice and fish with potatoes. I had fish while my companion had the beef. My fish dish was disappointing with not much taste to the fish. Vegetables tasted fine. Starter was a bit on the dry side. Dessert was heavenly. My companion said the beef tasted good. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured with a smile. They didn't seem to think of this as a chore. Cabin crew were helpful and joked with some passengers. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. Fortunately the flight was only 70% full and I switched to the 2nd seat. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.,Promoter

Candlelight dinner was a clever idea, but wine choice was very poor, 2-3-2 seating in business is not good, especially the middle seat. Amenities pack was poor, Bentley and Furla. The downsides to me were the zoning of seats it was a free for all. Some staff were rude MIA to IST, asking if my wife was in the right seat?

" Columbus to Venice via Toronto, we were booked on our outbound flight with Air Canada rouge. I say unfortunately because the resulting experience with them was just that.

They offered iPads which could be rented at a cost, however the in-flight staff never offered these to my wife and I. The food was sub-par, and overall was a very poor experience. Air Canada rouge wants 35 days to review my claim and assess whether or not I will be reimbursed for the $500 USD I had to spend in order to put together a wardrobe to get through the trip.

United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.,Passive

The Friday 10.30pm flight suits me and the couple of hours transit in Cairo is a small price to pay when you can arrive at SSH at 9.00am and have the whole day there. The food and drinks are fine why people especially British are expecting alcohol when it is a Muslim airline is beyond me and surely they can manage without a drink for a few hours.

They couldnt get me another flight until 3 days later so I had to pay $300 for a new flight home. They told me they gave me a voucher valid for a round trip for inconvenience when I went to use it it was only worth $50. Spent 2 weeks calling them about this and every time it was a different story. All the representatives are like robots. Like they have had the most impersonal customer service training ever. ""Thank you for patiently waiting, please hold another minute or two while we look up your information"". Sometimes it's just not worth saving the money.",Detractor

"  I flew Air Europa from Valencia to Sao Paulo via Madrid. Upon arrival in Madrid at around 9.30 pm, flight to Sao Paulo was scheduled for 11.15 pm. We are notified that the aircraft would be late, no reason given. There was a bit of a riot being created at the gate with an exchange of nasty words between passengers and Air Europa employees. Finally, due to pressure from passengers, close to 1 am, they tell us departure will be 7.00 am. The airline refuses to provide hotel accommodation, instead they send the 300+ passengers to a shared airline lounge. When the 300+ passengers arrive at the lounge, there was only one employee to greet us and she needed to check everyone in one by one. Each passenger seemed to take 5 or more minutes until boarding passes and passport numbers were recorded manually. People were left waiting in line for about an hour or more. I was one of the first to get in, but there was already nowhere to sit, people were lying on the floor. The lounge offered some drinks and food which quickly vanishes and never gets replenished. Coffee machines are out of order. We spend the night there. We board at around 7, we don't take off until 9. We are given the reason for the delay from the captain: ""the plane was late coming from America last night"". After 10+ hour delay, we take off. Plane was old, lavatories were not in a good condition. Food was poor. The way back: flight from Sao Paulo leaves slightly late. We arrive in MAD ahead of schedule, however, at 5.00 am. Long story short: my 7.05 flight to Valencia is cancelled and I was put on the 14.30 flight, which is, what a surprise, delayed - we don't take off until 17.00. They did offer me a hotel for the layover, which was nice. But the rebooking process was as follows: had to exit the airport and go to the customer service desk at check-in level. There was no sign that says ""Air Europa customer service"". Nobody knows where it is, employees gave me the wrong directions. Customer service gives me a voucher for the hotel, but are incapable of printing a new boarding pass. I have to stay in line at check-in to get one. I make it back from the hotel at 13.00. Monitor says ""delayed"". Finally, a feisty employee was insisting that I check my small bag, because ""it won't fit under the seat or overhead compartment because the plane is small"". I asked if it's an ATR 42. She says ""yes."" I say, I've flown that plane before and my backpack will fit. I keep my backpack, it fits with no problem.",Detractor
Ignoring that the flight was late and meant I had to get a bus to Haneda from Narita to make my connection the SIN-NRT sector on ANA's 787 was immensely uncomfortable. The seats are the 'shelled' non-reclining type and are advertised as having a seat pitch of 34 inches but in practice I was only able to slide my seat forward an inch or so before my knees jarred into the seat-back in front. The result was 7 hours of night flight in a lot of discomfort and any suspected benefit of flying in a 787 totally lost. Staff were unerringly polite and IFE was good but both of these positives were overwhelmed by the discomfort. Why have ANA gone this route when their CX peers had already paid the price and fallen on the 'rigid economy seat' sword? Madness.,Passive
" Hong Kong to Singapore. The Pier First Class Lounge in Hong Kong was beautiful and food was excellent. The showers were clean and well stocked with amenities. On the aircraft the staff were exceptionally friendly, and took care of you. The aircraft was new and felt nearly unused. The seat was beautifully decorated and the finish was a massive step up from their product on the A330 and 777. The seat was massive and the amount of personal space and privacy was unrivaled by other business classes I've flown. The seat was very comfortable, and I slept very well on this early morning flight. The inflight entertainment system was new and responsive, and selection of movies and TV shows was incredible. The food was excellent but was not spectacular- as a short morning flight the selection of food and drink was not massive. The flight arrived a few minutes late and because of this, I missed my connecting flight with EVA Air to Seoul, via Taipei. However, the staff took care of this, and in less than half an hour had booked me on to a Cathay Pacific flight to Seoul via Hong Kong. The incredibly friendly and helpful ground staff truly saved my trip and deserved incredible praise for their hard work. This flight was with points.",Promoter
Port Elizabeth-Johannesburg on a quite old 737-800 flying with a packed Economy. The service was pretty good: nice cabin crew a tasty and complete breakfast was served as this was an early morning flight. Good selection of beverages. Comfort of the seat quite good. Landed ahead of schedule in JNB. Johannesburg to Cape Town: this second flight was a different story. Flew on a pretty new and well-maintained but empty Airbus A340-600 which was surprising to me as flight time is only two hours on this route. Cabin crew were not good: quite rude kept chatting among them for the whole trip in the back of the aircraft ignoring some requests from a group of Dutch passengers. A poor sandwich was served as lunch with the usual selection of beverages. The entertainment system was not running but I could notice it is not the new touch-screen version. Space for legs good with the usual 2-4-2 configuration for the A340. Overall the price paid was too high for what you get back aboard.,Passive
I booked to travel from MAN to AUH on EY22 on 20th Dec. I called EY's call centre to upgrade using miles/cash to business where I was assured that there are plenty of seats available and should head to the airport 3 hrs before departure to process this. The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem. Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product. I just wish they sort out the unhelpful call centre and bring back the old amenity kits in J class with Aigner products that were infinitely better than the current cheap substitutes.,Promoter

"Flight was picked because it got us from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Newcastle, UK in a reasonable amount of time. What BA failed to inform anyone was that despite advertising the flight from RUH to LHR as landing at 5.25am BST at LHR is that planes cannot land at LHR before 6am. So once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the Newcastle flight.

I flew from SYD to LHR in Premium Economy. I was very disappointed. I paid the extra over economy for the extra legroom (tick) but also for the dedicated bathroom and premium service. On the SYD to HK leg we had to use the crowded economy toilets. The HKG to LHR we had a decimated bathroom - but lengthy queue as economy passengers were waking up and using it. This was not policed by the flight attendants. The food was also the same as economy with no top up of your wine during dinner. Overall not worth the extra.

Everything else about it is uncomfortable from being scrunched into the corner to no window to tray table and TV being in the side of the seat thus narrowing it. Armrests do not lift. It is by the galley and the washrooms so lots of traffic. Staff were indifferent rushed and not overly friendly. Food was the usual economy stodge loads of carbs not much else. I had the chicken which comprised a dried out 2 inch piece of chicken instant mashed potato and 2 tiny broccoli florets so overcooked as to be almost unrecognizable.

If you're seated in the middle of the row, don't bother going, or be prepared to defend your rights to rest your arms on the armrests regardless of what your travelling companions think who are sitting on either side of you.

I use Ryanair regularly flying from Dublin to the Netherlands. You get what you pay for. Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline.

"Ukraine International from Gatwick to Almaty via Kiev. Very strict hand luggage allowance enforced at Gatwick, resulting in me checking in an additional bag for 75 Euro. Ironically, being a member of the frequent flier club I am allowed additional hand luggage, but I did not know this at the time, and, it seems, neither did the over-zealous check in agent. After rearranging luggage and waiting a long time at the service desk I was advised that the flight was running an hour late, but my connecting flight should be okay. European flights operate a ""Sky Cafe"" service, where food and drinks could be purchased. I did not do this but did get a free cup of water.

In Kyiv I was rushed to the gate for the flight to Almaty, which was held late for me it seems. There were not many passengers on board so everyone had 3 seats to themselves, but the comfort was not bad even though legroom was less than on the Boeing 737-900s.

They arrived on the next day's flight but the ground handling agent said UIA were the only airline that did not deliver missing bags to customer's addresses so I needed to go to the airport and collect them myself.

"â Unverified | London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier. Lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",Passive

My friends checked-in at the counter beside. Staff advised them to re-pack. She was very polite and helpful. Poor me, wrong counter, changed the experience. On cabin experience, everything went very well. Thai cabin crew on board was very very nice. She was very helpful, respectful and service-minded. All other crews were also nice. Overall experience over the Delta domestic short flight was good except only one bad ground staff at the check-in counter.",Passive
DFW-SEA in new 737 which was refreshing compared to previous AA flights on old planes however the new seats are cramped and feel more uncomfortable than older aircraft. In seat VOD is a huge improvement however it appears that AA will be charging for this in future along with earphones and food. Another downside is that the screen does not adjust. Even with the seat in front not reclined the viewing angle for a person of average height is poor and soon results in a neck ache. There is the question of service or more particularly lack there-of and attitude. This flight was no exception and service was delivered abruptly and with only occasional customer respect. I asked for a cup of tea (complimentary) and was given a cup of hot water and a tea bag on the side. With AA it's a case of get on board (sometimes you're welcomed other times you're not) sit down pay for everything other than basics (and if you want water mid flight go get it but be sure to ask permission if you're not interrupting the staff talking to each other at the back) don't complain then get off (and you might get thanked for your custom from an FA who might be sat on one of the seats - although at least the Captain often thanks you). On the plus side this flight was very punctual and baggage delivered quickly but that speaks more to the efficiency of others.,Detractor
"Our flight (EK507) got delayed by an hour and it left quite a sour experience at the start of our vacation. The aircraft was well maintained and the crew were quite welcoming right from the door. The food served on board was of decent quality, but they ran out of the non-vegetarian course by the time the trolley reached my seat. We landed around 45 minutes after our schedulued arrival, and we missed our connecting bus (Emirates shuttle) to Abu Dhabi, as it left sharp at 7 PM. The surprising part about all this is that Emirates dont take any liability for missed bus connections, as it is apparently hosted by a 3rd party. I hope that in future Emirates do take this flaw in account, so as to make sure that passengers missing the bus connection due to a flight delay are not inconvinienced.",Passive
" London to Sao Paulo. The check-in and boarding went very well and quick. The plane was quite old, it had a horrible smell like urine. At first, I thought it was just me who noticed the smell but other passengers were complaining too. We all thought the smell was coming from the lavatories but realised that it was the plane that had the horrible odour. The seats looked old and dirty. After several hours into the flight, I had become nose blind and had forgotten about the smell. The rest of the flight was pleasant, the plane wasn't fully booked there were quite a lot of empty seats. I had an empty row for myself which was great. The food was really good and cabin staff were very friendly.",Passive
Flew ASM-CAI-JFK in business class. First leg was an uneventful +2 hour flight. As scheduled departure was 4.10am not much to talk about. Service was helpful but slept most of way. The CAI-JFK was a long slog. Seats were ok in Biz class but IFE was functional but with minimal choice. Food (a breakfast and a lunch) was barely edible and more akin to the mystery meet of coach trips in the 1980's. Was astonished that EgyptAir did not serve alcohol on its planes. What particularly annoyed me was this was never noted in any part of their website. Service was sporadic and not particularly attentive. All in all I would avoid EgyptAir in the future.,Detractor

"  Family of 4 adults flying British Airways from Bangkok to London,and I wished I had done my homework first regarding aircraft type. The only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but that's where it stops. The seat was old, the footrest would not operate correctly. As a Oneworld Gold Frequent Flyer was able to get 1st row in Premium Economy. (2x2 by window). The pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long time. The food was probably the worst I've ever experienced, the main meal comes from the Business Class menu, not sure what happened in the galley but the steak was like concrete, could not be eaten, hence left behind (noticed other passengers did the same). Mid flight snack ok. Light Meal prior to landing was inedible, a lasagna that just the look of it put me off. Hence left behind. 12hrs 30min flight the catering is very average. We have now rebooked (at a premium cost) to fly back via Kuala Lumpur on the Boeing 787 with the new Premium product. Interesting to see how that compares. Would I recommend British Airways, crew wise yes, actual product/ catering etc, no. Advice, check which aircraft you are flying on.",Detractor

Flight from Manchester was full, boarding was fast and everything was smooth and efficient, flight arrived on time at Rome Ciampino. The return flight was a bit chaotic, the gate was like a bunch of farm animals and boarding was extremely chaotic and hectic. The flight departed over 30 minutes late and landed 15 minutes behind schedule at Manchester. Seats are really tight, I'm 6ft and my knees are pretty much touching the back of the seat in front of me. Cabin crew on both flights were very friendly and helpful. With Ryanair I have found that as long as you stick to their rules everything is a piece of cake. Would definitely fly with them again considering their low fares.",Passive

" San Francisco to Sydney. This airline will get you from point A to point B but not much more. You can see a big difference between flying an airline like Emirates and then flying United. Their customer service is very poor. One male flight attendant from SFO-SYD clearly didn't like his job at all. I asked for water because I wasn't feeling well and he made no attempt to get it, he had a sour look on his face the whole flight and he would just look at you instead of asking ""what drink would you like"" etc. Everything seemed like a hassle to him and every interaction with him was awkward.

"Recently took CZ from SYD-CAN-JFK and return in Business. The Australian legs utilise A330-200 aircraft with 2-2-2 seating. Flights to and from USA much better with 777-300ER, with a 1-2-1 configuration. Overall excellent value for money. Skyteam lounge in Sydney quite new and comfortable, although lounges in CAN and JFK have seen better days. Rather surprised to be conveyed to 777 by bus, I can only assume that as the aircraft were only acquired last year, steps are being taken to remedy this. Once on board, welcome glasses of champagne. Inflight dining a bit hit or miss, but I'm not a fan of Cantonese food so can't moan about that. Wine is pretty much ""red or white"", but the cabin crew are always attentive, with cabin walk-through so being common. IFE very limited, but with personal devices, it's pretty much a dying issue. I habitually use Asian airlines for trips to the UK and USA. Usually Vietnam, China Eastern and China Southern. Clearly not as good as the big three Arabian carriers, nor the legacy BA or QF. However, when it comes to value for money, there is no comparison. Would recommend CZ.",Promoter
"Auckland to London via Guanghzou return with China Southern Airlines. Excellent aircraft comfort and meals. Cabin crew well trained and very attentive, although their English tended to be a bit lacking at times. No problem with the flights. The only negative in the whole experience was Guangzhou Airport. The aircraft didn't pull up to the terminal building so you have to disembark on the tarmac and meet a bus to the terminal, which seemed miles away. Same with getting on the plane from the terminal. Also, we had a 7.5 hour wait at Guangzhou in both directions. Whilst the business lounge is comfortable, the food is primarily Chinese with very little western meals available. We would fly China Southern again, but would avoid the horrendous stopover in Guangzhou.",Promoter
"  Toronto to Cancun. Paid for Elite Plus and since they overbooked my seats, I was given another seat which was broken with the leg rest permanently up, going against all safety regulations, not to mention not given what I paid for. Leaving the resort, the shuttle bus did not show up until 1.5hours after the designated time. Meanwhile, no communication was made to the passengers about the delay and when we called from the resort, they lied to us saying first the bus was running late, then it broke down and then it would come at 8:40 am and showed up at 9 am. We arrived at the airport by a miracle, being the last ones to board the plane. When I asked Sunwing via social media what their policy was regarding ""delayed buses"" (because we strongly believe they just forgot about us and simply did not schedule a pick-up), they said ""we do our best to get the transfer bus there as quickly as possible and try to keep passengers informed on what's happening through the destination representative at the resort"" Love the world ""try"", not to mention there was no representative in sight at the resort. In fact, their competitor representatives were all advising us to take a taxi because we would miss our flight. Looking at their social media accounts, I've seen that many people had to indeed pay out of their pockets for a shuttle transfer to the airport because the buses were simply a no-show. Very unprofessional and should not be able to offer all-inclusive packages when they cannot live up to the expectations and required responsibilities.",Detractor

"  Bangkok to Vancouver via Hong Kong. Similar to my previous review, I was supposed to be flying Premium Economy. However, while boarding both flights, I was upgraded to Business Class. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a brand new A350. Though the seat itself wasn't different from the ones on the Boeing 777-300ERs, the refreshed IFE, alongside with the retouches of the storage space made the hard product a solid one. The flight attendants were professional. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 9-year old 777-300ER. I would say the thing that stood out to me most on this flight was the cabin crew, who were proactive. Catering was a big improvement from my previous trip, with meals served in appropriate portions and tasted amazing! Both flights departed and arrived punctually. Bags were quick to arrive and I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of arriving, which is rare when flying into Vancouver.",Promoter

The plane was new, with redesigned interiors, softer colours and LED lighting. As I am about 1.90 m tall, legroom is very important for me and I felt satisfied with my seat, as I had enough space to stretch my legs. The cabin crew were nice, welcoming and funny, so the flight was pleasant except for the commercial announcements that were very frequent during the journey. The flight was very cheap (around 20 Euros), so onboard sells are a source of profits for the airline. A good no-frills flight with an incredible value for money.",Promoter

We departed early from Baltimore and arrived on time at San Diego. The crew were really sympathetic and joked during the flight in order to make it faster for passengers. They told us ""don't listen to the comments of other people about the airline because it's nothing but lies"", which was quite funny.

"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet. All-in all a rather disappointing and unrefined experience, relieved not to have paid for this trip myself, and wouldn't recommend Turkish Business Class when other (in particular Gulf) airlines offer a far better long-haul product.",Detractor

Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special. AA service levels are average at best and can't come close to what is offered with the international airlines. The Admirals Club in Santiago was crowded and food selection poor.

Business Class LHR to AKL. LHR to Hong Kong leg was with Cathay and the HK to AKL leg provided by Air NZ as code share. On the whole Cathay was superior with the exception of the food which was excellent on Air NZ. Cathay business class seating provided excellent space and storage and the configuration 1x2x1 with each seat angled away from the aisle ensured privacy. This contrasted with Air NZ which had less storage and not as much privacy as seats have lower screens and are angled towards each other. The Air NZ lie flat bed with mattress was comfortable but requiring the crew to make up the bed was an irritation. The inflight entertainment was far superior on Cathay Pacific. The Air NZ controls were very dated and the screen was small compared to other airlines. Overall service from flight crew was very good with both airlines. Disappointing that a lounge pass was not provided at check-in because of the codeshare status and I was instructed to use the Air NZ lounge at Hong Kong but on arrival discovered Air NZ shares the Thai lounge which was disappointing to say the least. Codeshare also meant that I couldn't check in on line for the non Cathay legs. I chose the code share flight combination as it offered the opportunity to experience two different business class services. Next time I would select flights only from Cathay pacific as Air NZ was disappointing. I understand that the Hong Kong to AKL route is provided by older fleet and it felt like it.,Promoter

Our flight from Dublin, Ireland to New York (JFK) on May 5th was supposed to take off at 4:20 PM (16:20), however it did not take off until approximately 10:00 PM (22:00). We landed in New York, NY at 11:05 PM (EST.) We were supposed to arrive in New York, NY at 6:55 PM (EST.) When we arrived at the gate in Dublin there were no employees available to speak to. After some time, they announced the flight would be 15 m delayed. Approximately every 1-1.5 hours they continued to push back the time the flight would leave without any explanation. Finally, they announced it was delayed because of technical difficulties. We were also told that we would not be told if we would make it to Tampa that night until we landed in New York, NY.

"We flew from Heathrow to Kos on Tuesday 13th September departing at 07.25. As the flying time was between 3.5 and 4 hours long, we had contemplated flying Club Europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats, it didn't seem worth the money. We checked in around 05.15 and having previously paid to reserve our seats, everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. However, despite knowing people that work for British Airways, it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on any of the bands. In the end we had tea and toast at Gordon Ramsey's which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes. The plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast, which was fine. As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. We arrived a little early in Kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast.",Promoter

Air Canada promised us a passenger reimbursement for expenses we incurred because we had no luggage. Nevertheless, Air Canada they ignored my claim for this reimbursement.

"We had a good flight with Cathay Pacific Airways. I'm tall (1.78cm) so the extra space in Premium Economy was more than enough for me. Good entertainment options. The only thing that was so-so is that the food is the same as an economy class - so just average airline food on a plastic tray. Also, premium economy shares the same toilets with economy class. The cabin staff was alright.",Promoter
"AUH-BKK. Morning flight. Smooth check in at AUH airport. Security check as always long queues since AUH airport has not been able to catch up with the growth in pass anger numbers. Boarding chaotic and unorganized. Flight departed an hour late due to heavy traffic. Seat the usual hard and narrow affair. The very busy FA's tried their best but they were clearly understaffed on this full flight something I've noticed on another flight a month ago. What really upset me was the ""breakfast"" they served. I opted for the Asian option beef congee. It was about 100 ml of rice soup with a drop of Soya sauce and a few pieces of ginger. Beef could not be found. This was the most disgraceful meal I ever had on a flight and I fly a lot.

MEL-LAX and SCL-SYD-MEL recently. Flew on a mix of A380 B747-400ER and B767. All flights on time and the flight from Chile was 40 minutes early into SYD. Check in fast and swift. Seats comfortable. The B747 has updated interior similar to A380. AVOD IFE was excellent. Staff were a mixed bag. Some friendly and some were a bit cold. Only down side was food. Not good. Bread served stale. Salad frozen cold. The main portion tiny. QF have done away with the Cheese Crackers. However drinks were plentiful. Fares paid were good. Will use again.,Promoter

" My 16yr old granddaughter and I flew back from New York as part of an Iglu QM2 cruise package. booked 10 months previously.As stated on the Norwegian website, we expected the plane to be a Boeing 78 , but on receiving our flight tickets a month before departure, this had changed to Wamos Air. The plane must have been the first 747 ever to take to the skies. Our low fare plus tickets included checked in and hand luggage, seat reservation and nice and tasty meal. Our allocated seats were 9A and 9B before an emergency exit. There was no leg room in front of 9A, meaning I could only sit with one leg crossed over the other. The seats were less comfortable than a park bench and didn't recline. Seat 9C was occupied by a lady in her 60's and I am in my 70's. None of us 3 were able bodied enough to deal with an emergency evacuation. There were a few well built males 6ft ish but not fat) in the cabin who had to squeeze themselves into their seats. There were no aircraft magazines, food/drinks menus, no drinks or flight accessories, blankets trolleys or any form of entertainment whatsoever. The 'Nice and Tasty Meal' was served about 2 hours before landing in a paper bag and contained a bottle of apple juice, and a long refrigerated cheese and ham roll and small muffin, which were cold, dry and inedible. Many passengers boarded with oversize hand baggage, which couldn't have been weight checked, taking up whole overhead compartments and making it almost impossible to close the doors. More than a dozen other bags, including ours, had to be crammed into the crew's storage cupboard. Apart from serving the paper bags, this appeared to be the only 2 occasions when any crew were in attendance. The flight fulfilled not one of the expectations of a Norwegian flight and if this was their first flight for any of the passengers, they will surely never set foot on a plane again.",Detractor
I travelled from Mangalore to Mumbai on 28 December. Flight was delayed 20 minutes and we were promptly alerted of this at Mangalore airport. Check in was smooth and I received the seating of my choice. Boarding was chaotic. One Air India ground staff member announced that boarding would commence for rows 1 to 15 while another commented that boarding would start from rows 16 onwards. This obviously resulted in a confused queue of people. The welcome on board was pretty average however the seating (comfort and leg space) was just fantastic a luxury I had not experienced with other airlines lately. Only tea/coffee cookies and a bottle of water was served which is really appalling given that this is a 12:50 pm departure. Thankfully I had carried a sandwich with me as I had read about the cookies in another review. Flight was delayed 30 minutes overall however there was no announcement made by the captain nor any other announcements about arrival in Mumbai the weather etc. Overall disappointing except for the comfortable seating.,Passive
"  Hong Kong to Auckland via Bangkok. Thai Airways had the best price on this long route with a short stop over in BKK was happy to choose this, and the experience has been very satisfactory. A380 was very well maintained, 1x2x1 flat bed very impressive. Cabin crew are smiling and helpful. Enjoyed their food and AVOD very much. Later on, from BKK we flew on a B777-300 with also the new 1x2x1 flat bed, a full flight, but service did not suffer. It was still the same good service with a very good selection of 4 main courses (available for longer route) for dinner, plus desserts etc. Crew are present throughout the night flight with drinks and snacks etc. Managed a few hours of sleep and woke up to a delicious breakfast.

My husband and I travelled on MU551 from LHR-PVG and 3 days later on MU561 from PVG-SYD. The trip from London was fine the A330 plane was near new seats not that comfy but ok. The food was fine not western but it is a Chinese airline. Entertainment was good choice of films not great but enough. Flight attendants appeared aloof but came regularly around the cabin with water. No bar service apart from red wine. Flight from Shanghai to Sydney was also ok - an older plane with drop down screens and subtitled movies. Staff again appeared aloof however served water regularly again no bar service except limited red wine. Food was not brilliant. The worse thing was the Chinese passengers who would not follow instructions from the cabin staff! A couple of things to bear in mind - The Chinese do not deal with strangers well whether Chinese or Western even if it is there job to do so it is there culture not to smile at people they do not know. A lot of comments have been about lack of alcohol well this is a Chinese airline the Chinese culture is not a big drinking culture white wine is uncommon and spirits only for the wealthy. All in all the staff were polite but had a job to do which they take very seriously. I think one has to remember this is not a western airline and the main thing is they get you from a to b safely. Both flights were on time.,Passive
Been flying from Orlando to Washington Dulles every week since June their inaugural flight. Never saw such a decline in service. Upgraded seats went. From 25 to 45$. Seats went from a nice leather to a hard smaller seat that does not even recline. Just cram more seats. No leg room. Seven out of ten flights are always delayed. I have three more flights then going back to another airlines. Would rather pay more. Actually everything Frontier charges for it is cheaper to fly elsewhere.,Detractor

Generally I have no problem with Ryanair flights quick and effective service. I do think though more thought could be put into their timetable as flights arriving in Manchester at 23.45 means that there are no transport options from Manchester airport other than by Taxi very expensive to get anywhere from the Airport. Car rental village closes at 00.00 and the last train is at 00.01 with a 5.30 wait in the airport until the next transport out and most shops closed it is not an ideal time to be landing.,Passive
" Flew Houston to Denver. Sorry United but Spirit Airlines beat you in every department especially value and planes which are brand new. Can only imagine all the haters are United Mileage Plus members who can't break their addiction no matter how bad United service gets. Have now flown Spirit twice from Houston to San Fran and Denver. On both occasions I was expecting to encounter some issues but instead both experiences were flawless including on-line booking and check-in, airport service, quality of the planes, cabin attendants, pilots and punctuality which was early arrival for most flights. US seems to finally have a budget airline (sorry Southwest is not budget) where you can build a fare for exactly what you need and all charges are completely transparent. I highly recommend Spirit Airlines and I am the last person who would â€˜save' on airfare if there were any aspects of the experience that were unacceptable.",Promoter

" Booked with Air China mostly for their competitive price. The Airport check in process was acceptable, although a bit understaffed with only 3 counters open for a 300 seat aircraft. The ground staff were very nice to have allocated me an emergency exit row seat, free of charge. Upon boarding one thing that was immediately obvious was the unusually hard cushioning on the seat back, upon close inspection there appears to only be about half a centimeter of foam. The inflight entertainment system also performed mediocrely, with laggy inputs and in this flight in particular requiring 3 separate reboots, with each taking about half an hour. The food and drinks is pretty much what you will find on an international flight like this, although lacking in western style food in general. Overall an average flight that I would recommend if you are either an international studnet or traveling on a tight budget.",Passive
"  I'm quite satisfied with China Southern Airlines cabin service for my trip in business class from Guangzhou to Amsterdam. The VIP lounge in Guangzhou airport was of perfect setting, various drinks and food provided. The attendants showed patience to us during boarding. Because the traditional Chinese Mid-Autumn festival is on the way, they offered us Chinese tea and delicious mooncakes as desserts. Since I am a big fan of Chinese culture, I took some pictures under their permission. Enough leg rest room in the seat helped me to get a good sleep in 13 hours. A personal toiletry kit was provided in every business passenger seat. I appreciate this airline and I would choose it again.",Promoter
" Taipei to Munich via Shanghai. Overall excellent experience with Air China. Flight attendants were very friendly and the food was quite okay. Seatbelt signs were often left on even when turbulence was nonexistent or minimal, but had no trouble using the lavatories anyway.

I arrived at the airport 5 hours before the flight since I had to check out of my hotel anyway.

"  I flew from Adelaide to Lima. On the way to Peru, I had no complaints regarding the company, they were fine.

I arrived at 10.30pm to check-in for my 2am flight in Lima the following morning only to be told that I no longer had a seat on the flight although I had a boarding pass with a seat number. I asked them how this was possible and they initially blamed my travel agent. When this was further questioned, the lady behind the desk then told me that there was a last minute change of plane and it is now smaller. I was extremely disappointed as this meant that O would miss 2 connecting flights and not be able to leave until 1pm the next day.

Due to this I would not recommend this airline and would do my best in the future to avoid travelling with them.",Detractor
"  Los Angeles to Gatwick. A flight booked months in advance and then subsequently upgraded to Premium. Never mind that it was an additional Â£100 to upgrade over the phone due to the service not working properly online. Checking previous flights for the past few days - all OK, on time. Great. Get to the lounge early - OneWorld - excellent facilities and a perfect way to start our journey. Then the texts started coming. From a 2010 expected take-off Saturday, the short story is a delay until 0200 Monday. The key issue was having no ground staff to assist passengers, leading to a fair amount of emotion, uncertainty and pain in arranging own hotels, flights etc. Again, no doubt great when it goes well but with no network and no support, be aware that the costs come with a caveat that you are on your own should there be any issues.

"I travel with them several times a year. I fly between England and Germany. This year I have travelled with them 4 times. After arriving at Bremen airport today my partner and I entered the queue to hand over her luggage.

My partner was flying to Stansted which is about 40 Miles north of London. After 5 minutes of standing in the queue the Ryanair person working at the desk disappeared and was talking to her friend at the hand luggage and boarding card control desk. I went over and asked her why she was not manning the desk any more and she said ""because I only take luggage 40 minutes before take-off"". When I said ""but we were waiting there and you closed the desk without even telling us"" she then lost her patience and got really rude. Subsequently we paid the 60 euros. They call themselves a ""no-frills airline"" but in effect they are indeed an uncaring ""no-service airline"". I would give them one star out of 10 for their airport staff.

Recently flew Birmingham to Keflavik return. Prior to the outbound flight I checked in online and moved our seats to 10a and 10b both of which are in the Economy Comfort area and offer a little more legroom than standard Economy. There was one drinks run and one duty free run. The selection of films was adequate for a 2.5 hour flight. The return flight was onboard the specially liveried Hekla Aurora which was nice as it was due to do the run to Gatwick that day. I again had checked in online and obtained exactly the same seats so the return flight was just as comfortable. I enjoyed using Icelandair and certainly would again if I was flying to north America from BHX rather than travelling down to London. One tip though is that if you are checking in online definitely get yourselves into the Economy Comfort zone and in particularly rows 8 if you are travelling as a couple or row 7 which is just behind Saga class and is very quiet.,Promoter

"We arrived at JFK, checked in and promptly went through to the departure lounge. Bought our Duty/Tax free shopping, to be told we couldn't purchase it from that particular shop as we needed to go to a different terminal via bus. After a fiasco trying to find the lounge (building works going on and no clear notices), we'd walked the full length of the terminal to find our lounge had no Tim Horton's. Well it did, but it was in the domestic flight section, separated by a rope and we weren't allowed to duck under to get coffee so had to go all the way back to the far end of the terminal to get a coffee from Starbucks. That done, we went to find Duty/Tax free shop. When we asked a member of staff where the Duty free shop was, she smirked at us and said there wasn't one. Had I known this I'd have made my purchases prior to my flight to the States. Then we boarded our flight. The seats were ancient and everywhere appeared dirty. I'm 5'1 but was squashed into my seat which was lumpy and not comfortable at all. Dinner smelt like a cheap microwave meal and looked very unappealing. The staff weren't particularly helpful.

" This was one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. First the check in staff were rude and told us as we were boarding that the overhead bins were already full (why?) and we had to check in our cabin baggage. They told us that it would be checked through to Auckland. When I said no, they insisted or we couldn't fly. We still had a 12.5 hour flight from LA to NZ after this one with no carry on and whatever we could keep on us personally. Get on the plane no greeting, ignored. Inflight, crew scowling at passengers. One crew member, while collecting rubbish, looked each passenger in the face and just said ""trash"" at them. Land in LA, no idea where we had to go for our connecting flight, no info anywhere. Went to the United customer service and asked them, they were annoyed we were asking and pointed to where we had to go. I double checked that our luggage was checked all the way through and we were asked for our bag tags. The United check in person back in Washington hadn't given us any on our boarding passes! Finally get to Auckland, no luggage, even the carry on. United hadn't loaded any of it onto ANZ. Been home for 24 hours now, no luggage still. This also happened to two other people on our flight to NZ, they flew United from Florida to LA and none of their luggage arrived in NZ either. When I reached out to United, they blamed Air NZ.

DOH-DAC on A330 They used First Class seating as J seating so I managed to get a flat-bed. Food and beverage on that leg was not great dry possibly due to a delay out of DOH also the IFE has to be reset several times.

LHR-NRT-LHR. We were travelling with a baby and ground and cabin staff were accomodating and caring. Great thing about ANA is that your buggy is put in a large plastic bag and taken to the hold at the door. It is brought up at the door at the other end so no lugging a heavy baby plus handluggage through the airport. Sitting at bulkhead with bassinet plenty of leg room. Entertainment on demand and a wide selection of international movies. Cabin crew warm and friendly. Baby meal and child's meal served first. Child's meal nutritous and excellent. Our food was delicious from NRT okay from LHR but odd breakfast of piece of ham and cheese (I pinched some of my daughter's more substantial child's meal). Service method is strange to say the least and rather slow - 3 hours to complete and no one wants to sit with a dirty tray in front of them for an hour waiting for tea. Also switch lights on about 4 hours before landing which is excessive for those that want to rest more. Eyemasks and earplugs are provided on demand as are toothbrushes and paste but this is not really advertised. Interior of the aircraft spotless and toilets remained so throughout entire flight.,Promoter
"Being the first time flying with QantasLink, I was eager to see how standards compared with big brother Qantas. Airport Check In and security was all smooth through Brisbane. It was once I stepped on board that I noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane. Row 25 (back row near the toilets) and seats E and F which had no width and felt almost prison like. In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew. Would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue. Inflight services by Cabin Crew were excellent. Great breakfast options and Drinks. Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft? I think for the money paid for these tickets some IFE needs to be offered. Aircraft arrived slightly late which was confusing as we took off early - but the delay was not an issue.

"  For us, the return flight from Dublin to Los Angeles was very good, and Ethiopian did an excellent job. Their fare was unbelievably low (seriously!), their service was good (cabin staff were all very friendly), and any delays were minor (the route starts in Addis and picks up people in Dublin, so there is usually a 30 min delay). If you are someone who is happy to fly Aer Lingus, US Airways, United, Delta, etc to the USA, then Ethiopian (on this route anyway) are well able to match them. And the Boeing 787 on the route is an added bonus! In terms of improvements they could make, the food could be better and the in-flight entertainment needs to be expanded.",Promoter
" Denpasar to Bangkok. I've flown with Thai between Bangkok and Bali in the past on a Boeing 787 and a Boeing 777-300 and both offered good service whether in economy or business class. Presently Thai have a Boeing 747-400 plying the route, so it's clearly a far from new aircraft. That manifests itself in pretty basic in-flight entertainment options where picture and sound quality is a bit iffy. However for a flight of 3 hours 45 minutes, not only is business class offered, but on the aircraft on which I flew, first-class seats were sold as business class. Oodles of space (fully flat bed if you wanted it), and typically gracious and attentive Thai cabin crew. Dinner included really tasty Thai options and the purser personally thanked passengers for choosing to fly with Thai. Plane at gate 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

"DOH-CMB-DOH. Business Class. QR does not live up to its ""The World's Five Star Airline"" slogan on some routes. It could be three to four star service especially as they have varying business class products (seats IFE etc.) in their fleet. Outbound I carefully selected a B777-300ER when booking but they changed that later to an older A321 that did not have lie-flat sleeper seats on this 4.5 hour night flight that was scheduled to leave DOH at 01:05. It left DOH about an hour late due to the incoming aircraft's delay and failed to make-up the lost time when arriving in CMB. Boarding was very poor in DOH and CMB. The seats more like premium economy products in many airlines' fleets were most uncomfortable and the control buttons didn't respond well to make adjustments. No amenity kit was offered and the food served was slightly above average. It was good that there were only six passengers in the 12-seat cabin on that flight so we could spread out a bit. The two inflight staff members were very good and attentive. On the inbound flight the B777-300ER's seating product was in complete contrast to their A321 though still not on par with the latest offerings of some of their competitors and also their own B787/A380 business class products. The service and food were similar to the outbound flight. This flight was on time. The new QR business class lounge in DOH is outstanding and amazing in terms of design and services available. The new DOH airport itself is not as good as places like Changi in Singapore but a huge improvement over the old one. I would use QR again on this route due to their three daily flights to CMB and their OneWorld membership that allows me to earn Avios and Tier benefits as a Sapphire OneWorld member.",Passive
"  Toronto to Sudbury with Air Canada. For a while I was purposefully flying Air Canada over other carriers as I enjoyed their new inflight entertainment options, but I've reached the point where enough is enough. I could have excused the fact that on about a third of the flights I've taken the sound or screen is broken, as technology fails. I could have excused that they keep adding new fees such as a fee to choose your seat in advance (not just for legroom anymore, for any seat). But this time I feel that I've run into an inexcusably unethical practice that has significantly disrupted my vacation plans. I've been on a multiple-destination vacation, which will take me on 6 flights. Air Canada's pricing structure made it costly to mix and match airlines, so all six flights were with Air Canada. I had decided to cancel the third flight, and drive the distance instead, so that I could see more family members. I didn't care if they charged me for the flight, I just wanted to notify them of the change of plans. When I called Air Canada, they told me that if I did this, they would charge me nearly $400, a $200 cancellation fee as well as the increased cost of the fourth flight, as it would need to be ""re-booked"". Then they told me that if I didn't pay this amount and didn't show up for the third flight, they would cancel the fourth flight. So even though I was willing to pay the same for less service, they wanted to charge me substantially more. They didn't offer any justification, I'm assuming that it's just designed to take advantage of people who are in a tough spot and have to change their plans, regardless of whether it increases the airline's cost. Pure greed. Even if it leads to additional administration, I couldn't see this amount being reasonable. Then, to top it off, I had asked if I could pay more to switch my last two flights to a later time. Online the price was $761 if I was booking a new flight. However, I was told that to make this change they would charge me almost an extra $1000. I'm absolutely disgusted, and will definitely be sticking to Westjet or other airlines.",Detractor

Flew March-April 2013 - 7 times during a 3 week trip including round-trip from LAX-Shanghai and 5 trips within China including Hong Kong-Shanghai (round trip) Shanghai-Beijing Beijing-Xi'an Xi'an-Chengdu. None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated. We did have one recent American film shown but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and flight attendants are plentiful responsive and apologetic. Speaking of the meals the entree is always a meat/brown gravy rice or noodles congealed mass. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yoghurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks/Soft drinks are frequently served but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly. Also an FYI regarding switching off your electronic devices approaching landing - they initiate this process 30-45 minutes before you actually land. Seats were pretty standard for economy but if the person in front of you reclined the pitch was so that it made your tray table unusable.,Detractor
" Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn't working. Having paid Â£723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was Â£25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a Â£20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said.

"Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Once again I found myself flying with Alaska Airlines best. When I went to check in at the counter at Anchorage I was informed that my flight to Nashville was cancelled out of SeaTac. I had heard about some weather related problems which could possibly affect Alaska's flight operations there. I told the employee it was no issue as I could spent the night at the wonderful USO there. The flight was great - gracious crew, on time, clean plane etc. It was a redeye so we arrived at about 4:45 AM. I looked around and found no snow anywhere. I asked at customer service about this issue and was told that about 30 of their flight were affected. I asked why were other airlines apparently not affected and she had no idea. I was offered a coupon to stay locally but said no thanks and spent the next 26 hours at the USO, watching tv, talking with the folks and the great staff. The flight out to Nashville was fine with another wonderful crew. I had the BBQ sandwich and a beer. All in all this was good. I did note quite a few others on the flight were stuck in SEA overnight like I was. Other than holding folks up for 24 hours in SEA it appeared to be taken in stride. I will say that more than a few of us found the weather excuse to be somewhat strange though. Operations at other airlines were slowed down somewhat due to having to de-ice but no cancellations other than Alaska.",Promoter
" Cincinnati to San Antonio via Chicago. United delayed flight from Chicago to Austin by 5 hrs for vessel repairs.

When passengers asked when is the next flight they were told to go inside they don't know. When everyone was back at the gate they were told there will be no flights out they would have to wait until Wednesday (this was Monday) to fly out again.

Ethiopian now put the Dreamliner in service on the Bangkok-Addis route, a nice change from their old 767s. Meals are not really business class standard, and one of the 3 main dishes was not available on the Bangkok-Addis flight. The wine list is good, with some interesting and very exotic Ethiopian wines.

" Hong Kong to Seoul. Though the flight departed at an inconvenient time (in my opinion), it was a decent offering from Cathay. As I was in transiting in Hong Kong for 7 hours, it was a relief once we were on our way to Seoul. The Cabin Crew were polite and professional, looking out to assist customers wherever possible. Being a One World Emerald, The Customer Service Manager came and greeted herself and then I was offered some amenities for the flight, socks and eyes masks, a very nice touch.

I was given a hotel voucher, but I could not use the transportation vouchers given to and from the airport because no taxi service I could find would take the voucher. I was also given food vouchers which were only good in the airport, and were worthless because I couldn't take my luggage through security and since my flight was canceled and I didn't have a boarding pass. Although, I got on a flight the next day rather than a 2 day mess, I was booked in someone else's seat.

"First time Aer Lingus trip. SFO to DUB (and back this is a review of both trips). Ticket was over 1000USD so I was very surprised that drinks and snacks were not free except soft drinks and a tiny bag of pretzels. I have never experienced this on an international flight before. Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for ""afternoon tea"" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while. The waiting masses were rolling their eyes at this. The seat-belt sign was on the whole trip so in the end we just ignored it. All in all I will try to avoid Aer Lingus from now on.",Detractor

"  I read the reviews for this airline prior to my flight so I knew I was taking a chance, flying with Air Europa proved to be a big mistake. I was on a round-trip fight from New JFK to Barcelona with a layover in Madrid. All flights were delayed and the return connecting flight from Madrid to New York was delayed 3 hours but we were not informed until we actually got to the airport shortly before scheduled take off. They did give us a free sandwich from a local sandwich shop in airport which was good. The worst part of the travel was both flights had limited air-conditioning and I felt like I was in a sweatbox for seven hours, it was awful. The staff rarely came around and offered a drink even though that cabin was so hot. Also on the flight from Madrid they didn't turn off the cabin lights even though we traveled in the evening and most people were asleep they didn't turn them off until five minutes before landing. Also, they had onboard entertainment but the movie shut off every 15 minutes and I had to keep restarting it, at one point I just gave up. Because of the bad complaints I tried upgrade my flight to business class however on my first flight they told me I would have to cancel and rebook the whole flight which didn't seem like a good option for me. I tried at the airport to upgrade my return flight my they wanted me to pay â‚¬3000 so that wasn't going to happen.

"The quality of the airline has deteriorated badly. My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with prior intimation which was fine.

I met the worst ground staff at DEL airport who don't even know how to behave with a passenger and behave as if doing a big favour. I was not attended by any transit desk people and when contacted the AI staff asked me to run behind people on transit to other destinations that was just so cheap. Next thing was the annoying security check which took nearly 30 minutes with a quick immigration for transit passengers. The flight was quite empty and quite comfortable, with friendly cabin crew. But the flight was mostly full of foreigners and the announcement was missing in French and the really fast Indian English was really sad for the French people who kept asking me to translate what they meant. Arrival in Paris was very smooth.

"  Manila - Denpasar via Singapore. Out of MNL via a very, very old B772ER with the very, very old recliner seats with pull out screens in a 2-3-2 configuration. Singapore Airlines should retire or refit this plane soon. I don't think it's fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg. Onward journey from SIN to DPS on a more modern A330 with angled-lie flat seats and a 15 inch seatback IFE AVOD system. Better product with more stowage areas. Service was half a degree warmer than the crew's from the MNL leg, but still a bit robotic for me. Got the nasi lemak via Book the Cook for breakfast and was quite a tasty offering. Less drink runs this time, but it's a shorter flight. All in all, an above average business class experience, but SQ needs to up its game a bit more for the price they charge.",Promoter

I often fly on Alaska/Horizon flights between Montana and Seattle or Portland. My overall experiences have been very good. Flights even in winter have been on time and counter and plane staff have always been excellent. Value is very good compared with the few other carriers (Delta and United) that we have to choose from here in Montana. Seats on Alaska planes could be more comfortable as they are small and fairly stiff and uncomfortable but most flights are short so it is not a big issue for me. You can't carry on larger bags on the smaller planes but their a la cart process still allows me not to have to check in my carry on and pick it up after landing.

"  Me and 2 friends were flying to Yellowstone for a vacation. First of all, there shouldn't be a 35 minute layover in the Houston airport as an option. My bag had to be courtesy checked in Charleston, so when I landed in Houston, I had to wait 10 minutes for my bag. We ended up having 10 minutes until the gate closed for our next flight. We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn't let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn't they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says ""You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?"" Are you kidding me? She wouldn't comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren't liable. She couldn't get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip.

LAX-NRT-LAX on a newly configured 777-300ER and NRT-OKA-NRT on a domestic configured 767-300. ANA has great service and their planes always feel brand new. I was excited to experience their new fixed-back economy seats on the 773ER. Plenty of legroom in the non-reclined position and I love the fact that they configure their 777-300ERs in a 2-4-3 configuration with a double armrest between the pair of four seats. It's also nice not having the person in front of you recline BUT the seats are impossible to sleep in. I won't be flying their Y class again. They're supposed to be introducing a new Prem Econ class soon will look into that next time around. Food was good and plentiful and their flight attendants are spot on. Flights on the domestic 767s were OK enough seat pitch to make a 2 1/2 hour flight bearable. Anything over that might start to get uncomfortable.

Took flight 83 from San Francisco to Paris. One of the worst 11 hour flights ever. Got to my seat to find all of the electronics did not work. Notified staff before takeoff. There seemed to be some power to the electronics yet nothing worked. No light no music no monitor not even the attendant call button. I was told they could somehow reboot the system associated with my seat shortly after takeoff. After a couple attempts to reboot and two hours trying to get the crew's focus on the matter I was finally told that they would not be able to get the electronics of my seat working. They offered me magazines which is completely useless considering they dim the cabin lights and I had no light of my own which worked. So I got to sit in the dark and 11 hours of flight going out of my mind with boredom. What makes it worse is knowing that this airline would not have known that my electrionoc were not functioning properly before the flight boarded. Not only did it limit me on my ability to view the safety video before the flight started but it also brings into question why the systems did not work in the first place. The plane seemed fairly new and if the problems associated my electronics was not a simple rebooting of my system according to the crew then what was it that cause all of the systems around my seat to fail?,Detractor

" Sydney To Brisbane return with Qantas Airways. From check-in through to security, the terminal facilities provided by Qantas is seamless and easy to navigate. Once onboard the departure and arrival was on time. It was a well routined flight, which wasn't taken advantage by the Cabin Crew.

I think some re-training is in order to motivate and drive the team to the next level of customer satisfaction.",Passive

Our journey started at check in desk in Cork we had booked priority with Ryanair but we still needed to queue up with the other passengers considering there was only one desk open. We then went through security which was surprisingly empty and staff there were friendly. There was a fifteen minute delay that was understandable when we got to the gate we boarded with priority but once we boarded the aircraft it looked like a rubbish tip. There was rubbish under all the seats which was all the litter from the inbound flight. I expect the aircraft to be clean and tidy for the next departure.

"LGW to CMB via MLE and return Sept/Oct 2014. As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary ""A Very British Airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.",Detractor

"Mainly booked this Egyptair trip because we got a great price on a flight/hotel package in Sharm el Sheikh. That said, lets say that a great price is a great price for a reason - and usually not a good reason. Before even getting on the plane my customer service nightmare had begun. Our original flight was IAD to LHR (10hr Layover) and then to CAI and SSH. Well about two weeks before we leave, Egyptair cancels our layover in LHR, thus getting us into SSH a day early. That sounds great, but now I have to pay for an extra night of hotel. When I told Egyptair the issue caused by the change, they refused to let us cancel, reimburse any of the extra hotel night. In the end, I just sucked it up and paid. As for the flight itself, the leg from LHR-CAI was a pleasant surprise. We were on a well maintained A330 with decent entertainment and food. No complaints there. On our flight from CAI-SSH, the plane was an old B737. Bottomline - the flights were ok, but the customer and ground service was so bad that I cannot recommend this airline.",Passive

A long walk to the lounge and the gate at the new Shenzhen Airport. Lounge was mediocre. Priority boarding good. Now about the flight itself. Good things: seats very good comfortable and lie-flat a light quilt and soft pillows placed at every seat. IFE was very nice with headphones and lots of movies and other videos to watch but the ads are a bit annoying but can be fast-forward. Now the bad part. Staff didn't smile much makes you feel you're not welcomed. The A380 seemed under-staffed and I had to wait 10 minutes for a drink refill. Food seemed a little unfresh a mysterious sauce and meat? In general China Southern has 5-star hardware and 3-star staff and service in my opinion. I had used my FFP miles for this flight but if I had actually paid I might not be happy with the service quality.,Passive

"My husband and I have never experienced such appalling customer service from an airline company as we did for our flight from Lisbon to Heathrow on 17th October 2016. We arrived at Lisbon airport at 7:15am for our 10:05am flight. We were directed to machines to print out boarding passes and get luggage tags. An employee assisted us with this but there was just one assistant for 3 or 4 machines and very long queues in an extremely busy airport. We were then told to go to the baggage drop and this is where the trouble began. When we arrived, we were told that we were the 4th people on ""standby"". I said that this could not have been right as we had booked our flights on 7 months earlier (on 1st March 2016). They lady just shrugged her shoulders and told us that this is how TAP Portugal ""works"" and that the flight was overbooked. She told us that the best thing we could do was to ""volunteer"" and have ""protection"" and she proceeded to tell us all about this. It meant that we would be guaranteed on the 7:05pm flight - the two flights to Heathrow in between were also overbooked - and we would be given a meal voucher (12 Euros each to spend in the airport) plus 400 Euros each. She said that if we didn't accept this, we may not get on any flight that day, and, I would imagine, the next day and beyond. We told her that we were not interested in the money nor meal vouchers and that we didn't wish to wait in the airport 12 hours for a flight booked 7 months earlier. She strongly advised us to be ""volunteers"" - it also meant that, if there were 6 seats over and 4 people were on standby, we would be the ones not allowed to fly. So we agreed to be volunteers - we really had no choice. We were then directed to go to the boarding gate, wait until everyone had boarded and see if there were some last minute cancellations. We did this - it was horrible and we felt like beggars wanting to board the flight. The TAP employees at the gate were cold and lacking in compassion. The flight was 40 minutes late. The flight was full. They then directed us to Transfers, this meant going through border control 3 times. We waited in line for 2 hours. There were over 30 people waiting at one stage. We met many other people experiencing the same situation due to TAP's policy of overbooking. Eventually, we received the new boarding passes, 800 Euros on a Visa card and 24 Euros meal vouchers for our 12 hour delay. A hideous day all up.",Detractor

In between meals a fasten seat belt sign was on for long spells with no apparent turbulent weather and no one allowed to leave seats even to head to a toilet! No drinks were offered so people had to make their way to the galley. Once a meal is served it takes hours for the trays to be cleared. Passengers walked the trays to the galley themselves! Although the menus are handed out at the start (on one leg it was the wrong one) most often in economy the choices had completely run out and the only comment from the staff was ""we have bad news"".

" Deceptive and misrepresenting their low fares. Last minute cancellation of my original carrier, Delta, made it necessary to make an alternative flight plan. Southwest ticketing agent informed me that the flight was sold out of lower fares and only the higher fares were available. The 1 way ticket price from Indianapolis to Orlando was $414.98. Traveling with my son required 2 tickets, $829.96. Boarding the plane it was empty, hence we were lied to reqarding the availability of lower fares. We were simply gouged with the higher fare because of urgent circumstances. Called the corporate headquarters of Southwest and they gave me the story that low fares are not available for disparate last minute travelers. The attendant on the flight stated that lower fares were available for this flight as it is low demand flight. This simply is a poor business practice for an airline that markets low fares and has the deceptive image of a friendly and customer service oriented.

The aircraft was clean and looked well maintained, The seats were rather more comfortable than they looked, and even for my 5ft 11in the legroom was adequate. Two difficulties were that the departure from Venice was some 30 mins late and no explanation given (""Sorry for the delay"" is neither an excuse nor a reason, however heartfelt it is said) Also if you are giving announcements in English with a strong Spanish accent, you stand a better chance of being understood if you speak slowly , not at native Spanish speed. My big concern is that the cabin staff were very blasÃ© about my concerns that I would not have enough time to change planes in Barcelona as we were somewhat late and refused to contact the gate for the onward flight to confirm I was on my way.

ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich.

SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.,Promoter
Second time flying Rouge. Air Canada should take their name off of this disaster of a discount carrier as it will kill their overall reputation. Our first trip was with our 2 year old to Florida.

"Full flights on both legs. Free upgrade from Bangkok to Hong Kong which was appreciated. The other passengers make it a let-down flight but cannot fault Cathay Pacific on service. Flight took off late due to late passengers - missing our push back time, and also our number in the queue, but they still landed ahead of schedule. Other airlines are not as forgiving with what time you should be at the gate, and they definitely need to impose stricter rules. Food was great (same as Economy). Seat pitch and leg space generous. Staff were great, however one was slightly lacking manners compared to the others. HK - London. Another full flight and the staff coped very well considering. A shame that airlines do not have other restrictions on hand luggage as when nearly every passenger brings on a hard shell suitcase, you are forced to have your bag under your seat for being the more considerate flier with a smaller bag. IFE was great. I have flown with CX quite a lot recently so I had already caught up with all the latest films but great selection overall. Food was great (Hagen Daaz is definitely a plus!), snacks available and they were prompt with all my requests. Seat pitch not bad. Leg space is OK, but if you have a lot in the front pocket, it is reduced somewhat. Landed ahead of schedule. Pity London is not well prepared for the influx of passengers as clearing passport control took an hour.

" My Air Canada flight left Hong Kong at 20.00. A meal was served shortly after take off. It was so bad I left almost all of it. If I'd had any idea that would be the case, I would have brought something on board. Talk about stale, you couldn't even get a fork through the dessert cake. Surely someone should be checking the quality of the food. To add to my disappointment, there was only one opportunity for a beverage. I would have dearly enjoyed a second glass of wine, but it was not an option. Clearly, either a tea totalling crew or that's the new limit. There was not an option of a snack or non-alcoholic beverage. Shortly before landing, we were served breakfast. I can't remember exactly what it was, but again, it was not good and the bun was so stale, I couldn't even tear it open with my fingers. Why even serve bread that must be a month old? Doesn't anyone do a quality check? The entertainment options were poor. Most movies were old. I think there might have been only a couple of current films offered. Seating was fine, but given the upcharge to fly premium economy it was not worth it. I've flown long-haul flights with Air Canada before, sometimes business class, sometimes economy. Sometimes the flights were good, but more often than not, the food is poor and the flight attendants seem to act as they would rather be a home. Last time I will fly an Air Canada long haul flight.

" Purchased a very cheap ticket (less than USD600) for Taipei to Madrid via Beijing, returning from Paris. While this was not the best airline I have flown, I got there and back on time and safely. All flights arrived early or on time. Boeing 787 was a comfortable aircraft but nothing special, while the older A330s were less so, but still acceptable. I had no major issues, although I may just have been lucky. It seems most of the bad reviews are due to delays or cancellations and lost bags (which I was lucky not to experience). The food was quite average but edible, although mostly Asian style so might not suit those who are not used to eating average quality Chinese food. It's true that the staff and attendants don't speak good English so you might also have issues there (I speak some Mandarin) and the in-flight entertainment is not great (bring a book or tablet). Also, facilities such as immigration, security, signage etc at both Beijing and Shanghai airports are poor, and while these are not the fault of the airline, they affect the customer experience. In summary, if you get a cheap ticket and remember how little you paid when you fly, you can probably consider Air China worthwhile. If you can afford to do so, you should probably fly another airline to avoid the risk of running into issues.",Passive

" . As a low-cost airline Norwegian charge for literally everything. Seat reservation on the LowFare is $35, 10kg is your combined carry on and personal bag allowance.

If you need a blanket, pillow or ear buds you need to pay. They don't even offer water. I asked for it when the flight attendant skipped me and she handed me a plastic cup. When they were going around with a coffee, I asked for it (knowing that for Nespresso coffee you have to pay but this was a regular coffee) and the flight attendant looked at my airport-bought sandwich on the tray and asked if I purchased a meal on the flight. When I answered No, she said you have to pay for coffee. When I arrived to the JFK two hours before my flight I saw the longest ever check-in line. They changed the gates just before boarding. I'm writing this is because they charged me $100 for 0.5kg more in my carry-on / personal item. Cabin baggage must be below 10kg so everything you have with you has to be 10kg or less. They don't even give you receipt for that but instead they stamp your boarding pass with â€˜paid'.",Detractor
"  CX889 from Vancouver to Hong Kong then CX703 from Hong Kong to Bangkok. Due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft, the flight from Vancouver was delayed by approximately 5 and a half hours. Check-in in Vancouver was a frenzy, with ground staff breaking the news to the passengers at half past midnight while trying to rebook as many passengers onto other flights (which were also extremely full, due to Spring Break). I have once stated this in one of my reviews, but it seems as if the ground staff in Vancouver are deteriorating. I was given told to ""go home and come back at 4.30am in the morning"". Dull responses such as ""We don't even know if the flight will leave. If the plane has a problem, we'll have to cancel the flight. But we won't know until 6.30am in the morning."" It was 1 in the morning, like how am I supposed to get home at this time? I was completely stressed out and realized I was going to miss my connecting flight to Bangkok. Nonetheless, I made my way to the lounge where the staff were much more understanding and tried their best to get us settled in before our flight. I was offered a bowl of noodle soup and blankets. Hence, I was able to grab a 4-hour nap before the flight was announced to be operational. I also managed to grab a shower before boarding which immensely helped me with my bitter mood from the night before. Vancouver to Hong Kong on the Oneworld livery aircraft. Crew was flawless and worked hard, non-stop, throughout the trans-Pacific flight, offering drinks and cup noodle every half an hour midflight. Arrived Hong Kong at almost noon time (originally scheduled for a 7am arrival) to an army of ground staff handling misconnections. I was rebooked onto the 8pm flight to Bangkok, and Cathay gave me a hotel room and a meal in the airport hotel as a compensation. The staff that assisted me offered every communication tool possible for me to communicate with my parents, who were waiting for me in Bangkok, as well as apologizing several times for the delay. I must say, although frustrated, I was impressed by how well all the staff in Hong Kong handled the misconnections, unlike the ones in Vancouver that weren't willing to help since they ""couldn't confirm if the flight was leaving or not."" (P.S. I didn't even receive my luggage tags upon check-in in Vancouver and the Hong Kong staff managed to get it for me in seconds). Hong Kong to Bangkok on a full Airbus A330. Cabin crew were trying their best to serve to everyone's needs, but with all seats in Economy filled on the flight, there were moments where I felt the service was a bit robotic. Nevertheless, all problems aside, I had a pleasant time flying with Cathay Pacific. It was a hectic situation well handled, so kudos to the Hong Kong ground staff!",Passive
"  Flying American Airlines is one of the worst experiences I've had in a while. Not only was I given a 1 hour notice that my flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Washington Reagan had been cancelled, and rebooked for the following day, causing me to miss work, but then my bag was checked when there was plenty room on the plane. I said I didn't want to check it, but they did it any way because it 'didn't fit the size requirements'. However it fit in my departure flight. I argued that if it was the same plane then it should fit on the flight returning to DC. They refused, yet allowed larger bags to go after mine. I thought flying Spirit Airlines was bad, but now I have two airlines that I will avoid in the future.",Detractor

I received a smile and two glasses of white wine. 15 Min later they distributed food and beverages, where the beverage trolley followed close to the food trolley. Crew worked with a smile. Beverages and food were good for an economy meal, wines were even good. Throughout the flight crew passed by and served beverages. The IFE was high class and the internet was poor as usual.

" Traveling with Ryanair has been an absolute nightmare. In a nutshell: I was travelling from Budapest to London Stansted. The flight had more than 2 hours delay when leaving Budapest. When we arrived in London at late night we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get out of the plane, since no bus was available to pick us up. After other 30 minutes queuing at passport control, we had to wait almost one hour for the luggage before we were informed that it could take few hours to be delivered, since there were no worker available (apparently they were on holidays or on strike). There were many passengers from other flights in the same condition. There was only a Ryanair representative, clearly overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation. He finally provided us with a number to call the day after to have more information about our luggage. He did not tell us to file any report nor he provided us with any written information. When I left the airport it was 3am and no trace of my bag. The day after I tried to call that number maybe 20-30 times and none never picked up the phone. I had several chats with Ryanair representatives on the Ryanair website and I was just told to call the same number which doesn't work or where nobody picks up the calls. I was told further by Ryanair representatives on the chat that when I call that number they will be able to fill with me a missing luggage report, because without it nobody can do anything. As I said before, the Ryanair representative at the airport did not mention that we had to file such a report, but he just provided us with the mentioned number to call. I have also filed several reports and complaints via Ryanair website by using different forms, nobody came back to me with any response. If I wanted to file a query with Ryanair Baggage Claim Form, I could not do it, without the missing luggage report number. Ryanair didn't provide any different number where I could speak to someone who could effectively provide for help. I was finally advised to go to the airport to look for my luggage personally, since they could not do anything to help me. When I asked if I was going to be reimbursed for the travel expenses and for the time spent to go the airport, Ryanair representatives said that it was unlikely. Today still no trace of my luggage, I have received no answer to my emails and complaints, and the famous number is still not working. I will clearly avoid Ryanair in the future and I would suggest anyone to do the same.",Detractor

Check-in staff said the flight was cancelled because the airplane didn't arrive from Hong Kong last night due to operational issues.

"  Flew St. John's to Las Vega via Toronto with Air Canada. I am so disappointed in the treatment I received during boarding at the beginning of my vacation today. It really put a sour start to my vacation. There was no room for my carry on luggage because people had bags and coats overhead. I was forced to check my carry on and I had to transfer my things such as medical items and other expensive things into a garbage bag that I had to ask for instead of being offered. During this, the flight attendants threatened to put us on later flight! Never even said sorry! I strongly believe they could have improved the situation by simply checking the overhead storage for small bags and coats and asking others to put it under their seats. They also could have been a little patient. I am currently dragging heavy garbage bags around the airport. They definitely could work on their manners and attitude.",Detractor

The plane was clean and so were the bathrooms contrary to many reviews I had read. The problem I had was when Spirit had to cancel my return flight due to weather with no options to return home for 5 days. I actually had to purchase a one way ticket home with another airline.

A nice Scandinavian whole grain bun with something in it would be super! When flying domestic in Sweden I usually fly BRA, because of their inflight service. It's not just the cost of the bun but also the value of the atmosphere it creates in the cabin, when the staff is given a pretty simple tool to give service to the guests.

"This is an impressive and smooth aircraft and I had waited months to my first AA787 experience. For that reason I flew from NY to Buenos Aires via DFW. I've flown other 787s and this aircraft's first impression is created by the incredible effect of its smart lighting and design. Boarding AA's 787 from DFW to EZE was nothing like it. The cabin was quite dark and it felt very cold and claustrophobic. Overall the crew showed a lack of knowledge of the product and did not know how to help passengers enjoy the excellent experience flying a 787 is in itself. AA's 787 has, in my opinion, very decent and comfortable seats (I slept over 7 hours) and great personal space. But entertainment did not work for a portion of the flight and crew members did not seem to know how to fix it. Service was very slow and very impersonal and it seemed as if it was short of 1 or even 2 crew members. There was nothing memorable about the food, but who flies AA for its culinary virtues? So it was ok. Although I did not pre-order my breakfast before falling sleep, I was fully awake when that service started, yet they skipped me, and I was informed that because I did not tell them a few hours prior that I wanted to eat in the morning, they might not have much left for me (at the end I was served the full meal). I loved being on this aircraft and will look forward to my next flight in it. Too bad AA is missing the opportunity of incorporating decent service to an amazing aircraft in order to deliver the wow factor of other carriers' 787 operation.

It's unbelievable that United continues to use ageing Boeing 747's on transpacific flights. 747's don't even have monitors behind the seats in economy class! Very disappointing when you can't choose what to watch on an 11 hour flight! In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled.

I had an important event to attend in Chicago the next morning. When I approached the agent you could tell right away that she didn't care. I tried to find an earlier flight from a nearby area or even just one that got me close to Illinois. I offered to drive from Raleigh part way to catch a flight or even drive from outside Chicago a couple hours...if she could just get me close. The response I received was that my request was too difficult and required too much work on her part. I then asked if there was someone else who could help me and she said I was free to go wait in line again for someone else who might be more willing to spend the time assisting me in getting to my destination. (point to note: there was no one behind me in line) I was frustrated and started to break down into tears (that's how important this event was) but all she did was pick at her nail polish and repeat the phrase 'you will not be making it to Chicago by tomorrow morning.' She then proceeded to tell me that I was not eligible for a hotel voucher because I was not based out of Raleigh? Well played. I travel a decent amount and have a lot of patience for people dealing with travel issues. Travel delays happen and I accommodate, but this time I really needed to get somewhere and American Airlines missed the mark. The least she could have done is shown a little compassion but no, I was treated like I was there to serve her needs as she saw fit. Would it have been so hard for her to ask someone else to help me? Apparently the purchase of a ticket from American Airlines doesn't include basic kindness for the ticket holder. Maybe you have to pay extra for that?",Detractor

The seat and private space was smaller than I am used to from flying with AA, but it is also a smaller aircraft. The seat offered a full recline, duvet and pillow. I found the seat fairly comfortable and although there was a massage function, it wasn't very effective. I also found there to be very little space to store anything small in the seat. Additional there was no call button for the crew. I was provided an amenity kit which was a very nice Tumi case. After settling in I was offered a drink. The TV display was smaller than I expected with an adequate range of entertainment. The aircraft was WIFI equipped. After take-off I was offered a hot-towel and had my drink order taken, then served a very nice dinner which I could chose from a menu.

This was probably one of the most professional premium class crew I have had the pleasure of experiencing.

Return flight was event worse: the airline communicated a delay but then started the boarding before the time initially expected! The ground assistance was very rigid.

I have flown several times always putting that bag under seats and also with Brussel's flight I could do the same.

The second leg in particular was very attentive, proactive staff, who addressed passengers by name, and were generous with drinks and food. KLM has great tableware, and all of the meals were pretty good too. Their amenity kits leave a lot to be desired (no skin care) but little touches - like coming around with a box of chocolates, offering plenty of snacks, and the gift of the gin-filled Delft house - really make up for it.

I travelled to Florida in March and was quite surprised at the services offered by Rouge. I was shocked to think that we had a 3 hour flight with no inflight TV screen to be able to watch movies etc. I detest the assumption that everyone has a device to be able to watch a movie etc. and always considered it part of the entertainment provided on my flight.

"We were looking forward our Emirates experience a lot, since I heard so many things about that company. We flew 4 sectors within 3 weeks with them, and the check-in on all airports used was smooth and didn't take us long even though we were economy passengers. Aircraft were average, typical Boeing 777 but I could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors, so seating was ok. I was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. Cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines, the performance was just average. The inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke, once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. On all 4 sectors only one meal was served, not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. Emirates competitor on flights to Dubai does a lot more with less crew. Duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again. So why does Emirate put so much crew in the cabin if they don't have to work during the flight. I have to say that the tickets were quite cheap but others who paid more probably had the same experience.",Passive

Food was okay, I chose Pasta over Beef. Overall, was a good flight. A precaution is that if you would like water at other times out of the drink service and landing, you have to ask the flight attendants for it, and they do not speak too much english, so basic Spanish will most likely be needed.

The aircraft was beautiful and clean however I paid for extra legroom and I found myself next to an emergency door which I had no problem staying on however the seats did not have a movable armrest. I had a row of two for myself but I was not able to move the armrest because it was stationary. The seat also felt kind of narrow. I was served a hot meal, two snacks, plenty of drinks (alcohol beverages included) and a light breakfast. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment selection was mediocre with only a handful of movies and TV shows. I am a big fan of the Boeing 777 because it is spacious, relatively quiet and depending on the airline the amenities can be quite good. Overall I would definitely fly Air Canada again because they were friendly, I felt safe, and they got me to my destination on time. They still have room for improvement when it comes to the entertainment offerings, the comfort of the seat, and please do not have United personnel do your checking at the airport it ruins the first impression.",Passive
I flew Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Phoenix. I'm 5' 11 and had no legroom at all legs were tight for two days after. On the way back I upgraded my seat to row 4 right behind 'first class' get more room. Room was a bit better for and extra $40 but the flight attendant in first class was unbelievable. 5 of 18 seats were empty but she would not allow for anyone to take a pillow for use - this was a red eye flight. She actually reached over the seat from empty row 3 and pulled it from the window seat passenger and then woke up his wife to take the one she was using. Then she was rude about it when asked why. Inflight entertainment was awful- besides inconsistent connection- many had it reset several times- the content was bad. Bad leg room bad service and bad inflight entertainment. I'll never fly Rouge again.,Detractor
"SFO-DXB/SIN-SFO Our first time on CX Premium Economy. Seats are fairly comfortable with decent legroom and an excellent VOD system. Food not much different from that served in Economy and they acted surprised when we requested a cocktail before dinner.

All in all not a bad experience but they have a long way to go to match the Premium Economy of Air New Zealand and Qantas.",Passive

I had no ways to contact them because its was after office hours. As a result I got a penalty of no show fee. And they had to cancel the entire itinerary which means I have no return flights to go home. And now that its peak travel period, I had to spend more than triple the original flight fare to get a ticket to go home.",Detractor

Friendly crew - I was not allowed to put anything under the seat in front of me for takeoff or landing but the crew looked after and returned it. Note, passenger sitting on the aisle seat.

Hopefully the same will ultimately happen with airBaltic.",Detractor
"LAS-ORD Nov 15 2014. ORD-MSY Jan 14 2014. MSY-ORD Jan 17 2014. Some people are just ruthless. Yes you pay for everything but even then it is probably still cheaper than a traditional airline. A simple google of their additional fees (such as their baggage fees carryon fees printed ticket feeds etc.) and you will see them. Many flight delays and cancellations are not even controlled by the airline. I have flown them twice so far and it was uneventful. A situation arose in which I had to cancel two of my flights. Their cancellation fees are crazy (something like 130 bucks each booking) and the rest is credited to your account. Well instead of cancelling the flight instantly like so many people do I waited a couple of weeks closer to the date. Sure enough they changed the flight time of my flight by only 15 minutes which allowed me to cancel my flight at no charge and receive a full flight credit back to be used on future air travel. I used my two round-trip tickets from Fort Myers to Chicago and on a 50 dollar off promotion day was able to book four total round-trip flights for only 15 bucks more (wanted a better flight time). I would have never been able to book like that on other airlines. Oh and the round-trip flights that came from that uneventful on-time sometimes early and on a nearly empty plane. This airline is not for you if you struggle to read what the cost of everything is and expect 5 star service. There is a reason this airline charges a ""bare fare"" because you are paying for you and a small bag not a small army. I have flown major carriers many times that incur huge delays and cancellations too. I understand the inconvenience that a delay or cancellation may cause but sometimes it is a part of flying. Everyone is so adamant about ""no cancellation fees"" or free baggage when I saved over 200 bucks round-trip to the same destination nearly months apart on everyone's seemingly favorite airline that starts with an S (not Spirit). Yes you get what you pay for and if you want to pay more for no baggage fees no cancellation fees no boarding ticket printing fees no carryon fees no drink fees etc. then pay for those items upfront like you do on other airlines. Me on the other hand I enjoy flying on an airline that charges me far less than other airlines and I can take twice as many trips with a little carryon than other airlines with a couple huge ""free"" bags and a little more leg room. At least Spirit charges by the item and doesn't group them all together like other airlines. If it costs you more to fly on Spirit than other airlines it is dare I say it probably your own responsibility. Nobody wants to take accountability for not reading these fees and that just doesn't fly with me. I had to cancel my flights knowing when I booked that if I did have to I would have to pay for it. And I did on one of them. Plain and simple just read and if you want a cancellation security blanket to tuck you in at night then please use another airline. Some of the delays and cancellations will happen on those airlines too.",Promoter
"We were set to travel from Vegas to Dallas then to Orlando then to Gatwick. The nightmare started on our first flight, flight was delayed due to cabin crew being late, when we got to Dallas we had missed our connection due to the previous flight delay, we then get told we can go on the next flight but it was fully booked so we would be put on standby. We made them aware we had more connections to get to, they couldn't of cared less! After my partner explaining we needed to get home due to commitments etc they put us on a direct flight, after they booked it then told us it was to Heathrow airport which is 45 mins from where our car was in Gatwick. Advised that the airline would pay for our bus journey so we took it. When we arrived in Heathrow our nightmare continued as American airlines had now lost our luggage. When we realised the luggage was missing we went to a help desk just to file a report and to be told to go home and our luggage should arrive later that day and all will be ok.

You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty.",Passive
I use a wheelchair and flew from Berlin to Bangkok via Doha. I did the booking in April 2015 and all seats were confirmed. When I made the web check in my companion got other seats than I. At check in it was not possible to solve the problem. Doha to Bangkok I got other seats. It was not possible to receive my wheelchair in Doha. I had to use an airport wheelchair which was too small. The transfer to my seat was also not very professional with their right equipment. On the way back in BKK I didn't get the confirmed seat. I got a seat (43D A380) with unmoveable armrests and it was difficult to sit down. The food was on both legs the same and the bar service was good.,Passive
" I chose American Airlines for my recent trips along the East Coast. I was doing the following routing: JFK-BOS-JFK-BWI-JFK. I must say that AA has become my favourite carrier for domestic trips. All these flights were on time, staff were friendly, I was checked-in within seconds, there was no hassle at security and without exception all flights were punctual. My best flight however was the one from Boston to New York on a transcontinental A321. I got a comfortable seat in the business-class section for this short 40-minutes-hop into JFK. But it was the captain who made this flight so special. As it was a clear and beautiful day he encouraged the passengers to look out of the window. And they actually did so. The Captain went as far as pointing out some sights en route and commenting on them. It was like flying in the 1980s when inflight entertainment on shorthaul flights was non-existent. After landing the entire crew - including the two pilots - stood in front of the cockpit and wished everybody a nice weekend. American Airlines provided a very personal and kind of nostalgic experience on this flight. I will not hesitate to choose them again.",Promoter
" Abu Dhabi to New York. Aside from being long, this flight was quite unconventional. I was sitting in seat number 48 K (the first economy cabin where the stairs are).

"Because of bad weather in Bogota was the Avianca flight delayed and we were not informed before boarding - after boarding we was sitting in the plane for almost an hour and almost no information about what was going to happen. Then asked to leave the aircraft also without any information. After 1:30 we was asked to board again, but just before we where going to enter the aircraft we were asked to go back to the terminal again because now there was no crew. Again we wait and no further information. After a while told that a crew was on there wayand we just should wait. An hour later the flight was canceled and we were not compensated in any way - even that it was Avianca that was the reason that was not flying. This was so bad handled and it will mean that I will never again use Avianca in South America, I will find another carrier. Another thing, Avianca is member of Star Alliance, an international group and the staff speaks no English or so bad that they are not able to communicate with people that do not speak Spanish. After more than an hour more it was possible to be rescheduled to another flight the day after and my connection to Sao Paulo the only one, so now I am 24 hours delayed.",Detractor
" Gatwick to Vilnius via Riga. Terrible customer service. We was denied our flight to Riga from Vilnius due to delay of their inbound flight from Gatwick. It was explained that we missed our last flight and should go to collect luggage and go to ticket office for travel re-arrangement. Lady in reception told that air Baltic offer for us can offer only ground transportation to Vilnius airport. When one gentleman asked for flight next day it was told that there is no chances to stay overnight (""no available hotels in Riga that night"") and that all flights from Riga to Vilnius on next day are fully booked. Then after doubts how it can be that all flights and hotels are overbooked in Riga she told that probably the is 1 seat, then ""maybe 3 seats"" in morning flight, but hotel for sure she cannot book, and if we wish we can do it on our own money and then apply to refund of 70 EUR. When we started negotiate ground transfer, story continue very interesting way - it was told that cab cannot bring us to hotel/home address, only to drop off in Vilnius airport. After emotional complains why we need to go by cab to Vilnius airport and then back to city by taxi at 5AM , she firstly told that it is because our destination is Vilnius airport, and we will be delivered right here (even if it is after 4 hour drive and no taxi in Vilnius airport at that time). Then after 5 min of emotional discussion she once again changed her mind and told that OK, we may take taxi in Vilnius airport and then to submit receipt to refund. When we told that this is stupid, that we need to cross all city and then go back, she told that ok ok you may ask transfer driver to drop off in your destinations only if this is on way to airport. No consent was given to sign for us, just she gave voucher to driver, and that's it. Now I have problem with insurance company. I not even mention kindness words used like ""sorry for inconvenience"", ""I will do my best"" or any provision of refreshments, etc. When we finally asked surname (name was on card) of receptionist she told that this info she is not obliged to provide.So, all long story short - airBaltic represented as it's best Soviet heritage of customer service with ""Service provider always right"" and ""No, we can't"" attitude. If you want this experience, you may try to travel with this airline. For me enough is enough! I chose airBaltic to London via Riga instead direct flights Vilnius-London with WIZZ and Ryanair because I was expecting more intelligent and kind attitude, and paid for it extra 100 EUR per ticket.

" Austin-San Diego-Austin, First Class on Alaska Airlines / Skywest E-175. Easy check-in with 3 bags to check. Enjoyed the Admirals Club at AUS, which still has a great staff, even though food offering are lagging Delta's or United's Clubs. Quick boarding as this jet only holds about 70 passengers. For a regional jet, seats are plenty wide and comfortable with average at best legroom. Power port at every seat is nice. Pre departure beverage and an on time departure. Right after take off, First class was treated to Virgin America's signature smoothies, which I enjoy and I thought this level of service, along with a printed menu indicated a fine meal was forth coming. I'm a fan and love airline food and never complain, however the meal, if you can call it that was the most appalling breakfast I have ever seen, on a plane or the ground. Half dollar size, dry and cold scrambled eggs and a salmon cake of similar size. Thats it. Beverages served in plastic cups. No mugs for coffee either. Just abysmal. The return flight, easy check-in despite the poor condition old San Diego's terminal 1. No lounges, poor food options, as we thought of eating before getting on the flight, due to the service on the way to San Diego. Fast boarding, no pre departure beverage this time, no problem, once airborne, printed menus again, followed by warm nuts in a ramekin, then a large, nicely presented dinner of chicken with wine sauce.

"  My wife and I chose Norwegian as it was the only airline to offer a non stop service from London Gatwick and San Juan, which was a god send for us, and the incredibly low fare. Norwegian are very open on their website as to what each fares offer and what you get with your ticket and what you don't, so we knew what service to expect. We chose the low fare+ ticket as we had cases to check in and wanted the meal option. On to the flight Norwegian operate a very modern fleet of Boeing 787's for long haul flights, I've never flown on one of these before and was impressed with the comfort levels in the cabin along with all the little extra touches (sub charger points, sunglasses mode on Windows, mood lighting etc). The IFE screens are very good also (the best I've come across so far for clarity) and offer plenty of choice. The moving map was also pretty cool. The inflight service on both outbound and return flight was very good, crew was very polite and helpful. The meals were very good and pretty tasty. Both flights took of on time and landed early. It's a shame Norwegian don't offer this service all year round as I would use them for this route all the time. They only operate between November and April to work with the cruises which is understandable but annoying as it would be great to have a non stop option year long rather than have to use another airline with at least 1 layover. The only small negatives I would mention would be the boarding process being a bit chaotic and unorganised. once they had board indeed rows 25-47 the announcements seemed to stop and everyone just bundled on. This happened both ways. Overall though I would 100% fly with them again and have already recommended them to others. I can only see them growing as an airline.

LHR-VIE and VIE-LHR: Both flights left 20-30 minutes late and arrived no later then 10 minutes of the published times. Outward plane a Boeing 737 and return an Airbus 320. The planes looked clean and well maintained. What lets the service down is attention to details and quality of human interactions. The drop down screens show a very old moving map and the safety cartoon. On the return flight the screen was just left down but blank for 40 minutes before some old cartoons were shown. The cabin crew appear to do what is required of them but with no great zeal. Passengers offered a drink and a muffin on outward flight. On the return leg a turkey and cheese sandwich. When I asked for a vegetarian option I was told directly and with no apology that there was not any. Mints offered after we had landed as passengers were on the way out. Another problem is that it is a very long walk at Heathrow to and from the gate used by Austrian. There are various means that help people a long but it can take up to 20 minutes. The new terminal in Vienna had a similar problem although not quite so bad but still a lengthy walk to passport control and I found very badly signposted. Next time I will fly with one of the other airlines. Departure on the return leg at the gate from Vienna was a bit chaotic and could have been better organized.,Passive

"  Milan Bergamo to Bucharest. Wizz Air is a low-cost airline, which delivers what it promises. When you only pay 9,99 to 19,99 EUR for the ticket, you cannot really ask for more. Read the rules carefully, stick to them and you should not be charged anything abusively. Delays happen and they are generally handled reasonably. Low cost airlines usually do not re-protect you on other carriers so if you fly on less served routes and the flight is cancelled you may have to wait for a couple of days for the next available flight. Overall, great value for intra-european flights.",Passive

"This is where my 4 flights of the week went downhill. First off, American Airlines changed the plane from a great A321 type that I flew out on to an old B757 - a much larger and much older aircraft. I thought I was sent back via the Twilight Zone. I hadn't flown in one of these in years! Anyway, pillow and blanket (neither of which I used) were at our seats. The seats were large but there wasn't any regular plugs to charge devices. Again, it was a 2 hour flight so no meal - just a choice of refreshments. Entertainment was provided via overhead CRT monitors anchored to the ceiling over the aisle. CRT monitors! The ground crew were very good and organized since there were many people at the desk due to the change in aircraft. Luckily, my reserved seat was still mine - just not in the nicer A321. The cabin crew were younger but friendly and professional. The captain was funny on the PA system. Overall and okay flight but thankfully short.",Passive

"Flew Rouge ""business class"" from Toronto to Las Vegas and return a week ago. I had booked business class originally from Ottawa to Vancouver to Las Vegas but Air Canada cancelled that as the connection was too tight and instead routed me through Toronto. They promised me that business class would be exactly the same on Rouge but it is not! The seats are smaller there was no TV screen in backs of seats - they gave me a tablet to watch but the content was poor. Service was not good at all. And on top of all this the price was the same!

" Stockholm to Hong Kong via Helsinki. Finnair will separate children from their parents in order to trick you in to make them a few bucks. This is my story of how Finnair forced my young daughter to sit by her self. It concerns flight AY101 on December 14th. Traveling from Stockholm to Bangkok through Helsinki and Hong Kong, I started check in 24 h before the first flight. For the first leg I could choose seats (within economy) for free. Seats with extra leg room - which had an additional fee - were marked with a $ sign. Doing the same procedure for HEL-HKG, I moved us from economy seats in the middle to 3 seats by the window. No $ sign on the new seats. A message that changing seats may result in a fee was shown. When finalizing my check in I'm shown a bill for about â‚¬70. As I did not want to pay that, I try to change back to our default seats, but am unable to do that - even though I try many times and google for solutions. I give up and decides to try to get things sorted checking in at the airport. At the airport they are only able to give us separate seats on the flight and asks us to try to change that at Helsinki airport. At Helsinki I try again, but am told they can't do that as the flight is full. At boarding I ask the staff to ask if any other passenger would be willing to switch seat, but no, they can not do that. They do can offer us Business Class seats - for â‚¬ 500 per person. So their defective check in system and their staffs unwillingness/inability to solve a problem - which I did not cause - results in that my young daughter, who is anxious about flying, is forced to sit by herself. Really bad! Except for the above mentioned I have no major complaints - but if I can not trust an airline to keep my family together, I won't use them.",Detractor

Surprisingly a substantial snack was served - a ham roll (or some meat, I cant recall) with a pack of local snack mix and a drink. For such a short flight, it was literally take-off, eat, land. Service was okay. The seat however was not very comfortable, despite the short flight - I felt my back aching after the flight.",Passive
 This has been one of the worst airlines I've ever flown in! I've taken this airline about four times because of how cheap it is let's just say the cheaper the ticket the absolute horrible service! I have missed my connecting flight four times because of delays! Last night I took united from Boston to Washington DC as soon as I got off the plane I ran for the next airplane which was taking me to NC when I arrived it said now boarding I asked him to open the door because technically I was on time and they refused they were super rude they yelled at me I am in the service so I need it to be back before certain time they refuse to let me talk to anyone else to get for their assistance I ended up having to take a vehicle and drive to North Carolina absolutely horrible I will never ever ever take this airplane ever again !

" I had a flight delayed and was re-routed through San Francisco (this is a very common occurrence - almost an art form in that first world country with a third world airlines known as the USA). The airline refused to provide boarding passes for the connecting flight as they are contracted to do. As such you cannot get through that pasenger - friendly organisation known as the TSA to get a boarding pass because Qantas deserts the check-in early. So I stood there for 45 min watching my international connection board and depart. This is the second time Qantas has done this to me. No offer of a hotel, no attempt to address this serial problem. So if you want to get out of the USA use one carrier. OneWorld is a con - its all talk but doesn't happen, Qantas is so full they don't care.",Detractor

GVA-AUH A320. Good food but after the main meal nothing else was served which I find a bit disappointing. Flight attendants served plenty of drinks throughout the flight.

NRT to CDG. Staff courteous but not attentive nor particularly warm or friendly. Like the experiences of other reviewers here after the first meal had been cleared away the crew appeared once with water and once with ice-cream then disappeared before serving breakfast. Meals were poor but a selection of snacks (hot soup sandwiches cookies and drinks) were available in the galley. The entertainment system was a disappointment after flying this route several times over the last years with other airlines. The personal screen was small and hard to see and movie choices very limited especially for children. My biggest complaint was the standards of cleanliness. The plane was obviously quite old (with ashtrays still on the doors at the back) and looked a little worse for wear (toilets looked particularly grubby) but there is no excuse for the lack of cleaning. When I unclipped my try for the first meal there was a used tissue stuck in there and the tray was covered in crumbs. Someone had either been sick over or spilled their lunch over the (very bulky) airline magazine in the seat pocket of my daughter leaving it sticky and smelly. Somehow staff were unable to regulate the temperature in the plane and it was quite cold (other passengers wrapping themselves up in whatever they had with them)- aside from 45 minutes or so in the middle of the night when the heating system had obviously been turned on full-blast and the cabin turned into an oven. The blankets looked very tatty and dirty and when released from their meaningless plastic bag proved to be covered in thick long black hairs. I opened all the bags of our party of four and they were all equally as filthy so went unused. In terms of value we booked the flight 9 months in advance and got a decent price but I hope I never have to use AirFrance again.,Detractor
We were flying from San Francisco to Philadelphia. The first thing I saw when we checked our bags in was how nice the staff were and there was peaceful music on with colorful seats.

"  My wife and I have just returned from a trip to the USA (Newark to Sydney via San Francisco) flying United Airlines business class. We've flown a lot over the years but have never experienced an airline service quite as bad as this one. After a long flight from Sydney we faced a 6-hour delay in San Francisco awaiting a connection to Chicago. At one point we boarded a plane and were preparing for take-off. The plane was actually waiting on the runway for the go ahead to fly. Astoundingly, we get a cabin announcement informing us that we were to be taken back to the terminal as the pilot had gone over his assigned â€˜flight hours' and couldn't fly the plane. You couldn't make this stuff up. Confusion reigned for the next few hours while United staff gave conflicting information. Firstly, we were told to stay on the plane and wait for a replacement pilot. We were then told we'd need to disembark. One said we'd definitely be flying that day while another said we might not as they might not be able to get a pilot. Eventually, a pilot did arrive and we did fly out that day. Unfortunately, the return leg didn't improve. We were scheduled to fly from Newark airport to San Fran where we would catch another flight to Sydney. As time was tight between when the flight from Newark was due to arrive and our connection from San Fran was due to depart, we decided to arrive at Newark airport early to see if we could change to an earlier flight. We were told by a rather surly United staff member that all earlier flights were fully booked. Strangely â€“ when I checked my baggage in, the check in screen told me that for $75.00 I could take an earlier flight. After passing security, we decided to go to the United lounge and ask service staff about any other options for taking an earlier flight. When staff saw the tight connection time between the two flights they were in disbelief. They told us that this was an illegal connection and we should not have been able to even book it. They then offered to put us on standby and as it happened, we were able to get an earlier flight. On arrival at San Fran, my wife noted that an email had been sent to her from her work. When we hadn't boarded our â€˜booked' flight from Newark our flight from San Francisco to Sydney had been cancelled. Service staff confirmed this and notified that our booked seats had already been sold and we might not be able to get seats on the flight. We were eventually assigned new seats but we might as well have saved our money and gone economy. Passengers were walking through the cabin all night and we had to put up with a screaming baby and the stench of diaper changes. The service was woeful and I've had better in economy on other airlines. Our seats hadn't been cleaned properly - there was rubbish and the screen control device was so sticky and dirty my wife had to wipe it down herself. Finally, when we arrived in Sydney we went to the baggage claim. After waiting an hour for our baggage we decided to check where it might be. Surprise, our baggage was still in San Fran. This despite asking United staff numerous times that our luggage was on the flights and receiving their full assurances. The service person in Sydney noted it was a common occurrence with United. When we turned around there was a line of United customers with the same issue. I realise others have had far worse flight experience, but ours wasn't great. You come away with the feeling that the dollar is definitely a priority over the customer.",Detractor
BA216 from Washington to London in World Traveller Plus on BA's new A380 (upper level) - one of the smoothest quietest flights I've experienced in 45 years of flying.

"My wife and I took Vueling flight from Paris Orly to Vienna via Rome on 1 October. Upon arrival in Vienna, we realized that our baggage did not come out from the conveyor. I rushed out to the ground handling office to file a report. The officer record the report and gave the lost report document and mentioned that it will be delivered in 24 hours. I am not happy but I have no choice. The next day I called to follow up and the reponse surprised me: there is no information of the baggage! How could that be possible? The baggages are tagged, computerized recorded and transported using a registered airline, but somehow no one can get any information of where it is! However, since it is not yet 24 hours, I decided to wait. And as expected, day 2 passed in silence. I revisited the ground handling office in day 3 and again surprised me by saying that they will contact their colleagues in Paris and Rome. Weren't they supposed to do that since day 1? Will they ever move if I didn't show up? Later in the evening I sent email and received a shocking answer: a request to inform detail of what inside the bags, to help the identification. Are they now going to open the bag? I don't whether they are allowed to do that but I clearly showed that there is something not right. Later, evening of day 4, I received a phone call saying thay the baggages are found and will be delivered between 21.30 to midnight. Of course, I receive it on midnight. And as I guessed, it showed how the handling was done in poor manner. Broken handle, the wheels are hardly move, dirty, scratches because the cover is gone.

"Check-in experience with American Airlines at Dublin was horrible-it took 45 minutes and during this time all passengers were subject to inept security 'interviews' with clueless AA staff.

Flight was on time to Philadelphia, late to Halifax. Food bad, but liquor offering good. Leg room was reasonable for today's Economy class. We were near the back of the aircraft, but this A330 has a sensible 2-4-2 configuration and we had the 2 by the window which is nice for a couple. Seat back entertainment didn't work for me, USB chargers on both seats didn't work. Cabin crew weren't exactly professional, and down right silly on the PHL-YHZ leg (not aware that Halifax has a different time zone, no idea of scheduled arrival time, generally inarticulate). The aircraft from PHL-YHZ (operated by American Eagle) had an old plane smell, and the bleak interior of the ERJ 145 seemed to be yellowing with age. Good communication from the pilots on this leg, which was necessary as there were repeated delays ending in a 30 minute broken down jetway farce at the Halifax airport.

"I flew from Manchester Airport to JFK in economy class. From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"".

Sydney-London-Melbourne on A380 with a family group of six ranging from grandparents (includes me) to parents to two 11 year old grandchildren. Originally booked QF9/10 from/to Melbourne but QF9 was cancelled some months prior to departure apparently as an occasional cost-saving measure by Qantas. Hence we were moved to QF1 from Sydney for the outbound leg with a domestic connecting flight in Business. Overall an excellent experience that includes the chauffeur transfer services spa and massage facilities at the First Lounge in Sydney personal escort to the aircraft warm friendly and genuine personal greetings by all cabin staff and Customer Service Managers on each leg great menu options top wines and spirits good entertainment facilities spacious individual suites and very comfortable beds. All staff were magnificent - efficient cheerful always checking if anything else could be done and they had great fun interacting with the children (and vice a versa). The only downside that prevents me from giving full star ratings overall was a couple of us had to queue for the toilets a couple of times because they were being used by Business Class passengers from upstairs. Obviously a legacy from when Qantas decided to replace two of the Business Class toilets upstairs with seats. I'm sure someone in the Qantas executive could identify a simple solution to this annoyance. In summary Qantas can be very pleased with the manner in which all staff looked after us.,Promoter

Food is very good for economy class. The main gripe is the comfort of these very worn seats. It appears the cushions were in need of replacing several years ago. .

Flew Hong Kong-Helsinki on AY070 10th Sep in business class. This was a connecting flight so the hope was our baggage would follow as planned. It did. Finnair use a generic business lounge in HK. Unfortunately it is not advertised anywhere or is any advice given where to find it. We ended up at a lounge which was not the intended lounge but the staff after a number of phone calls let us in. Evidently the lounge we should have used was at the other end of the airport and a distance away from the gate. Knowledge is good! Boarding was good and on time - priority boarding. Our aircraft was clean and the seating whilst not the most up to date arrangement it was comfortable - angled not lie flat. We did not sample dinner as this was an overnight flight and we were tired. We slept for 5-6 hours. Breakfast was a simple affair but was edible. The inflight entertainment was very average as far as choice was concerned. As we slept for most of the flight it was not a huge concern. We landed on time. The crew were terrific and helpful when needed. All in all not a bad experience.,Passive

Flew from Singapore to ICN and back in 777-300. My first time flying with Korean Air. Overall service is ok. It is the minimum what a premium airline would provide. My flight to ICN departed after 10pm and they served dinner at about mid-night. Only turned down the lights at about near 2am and woke us up at 4am to prepare for landing. No snack was served before landing at ICN. I would have preferred they serve us a snack after take off and breakfast before landing. The timing for serving food on the return flight was also a bit odd. Took off at 2pm and served us lunch at about 3.30pm. Then a snack at 5pm just before landing.

"  On 18 March I flew from Edmonton to Orlando via Montreal aboard Air Canada 192/1872. We boarded a Boeing 767-300ER in Montreal, and I was delayed almost two hours due to what I assume was a mechanical issue, similar to what I experienced last August. At least the plane left this time around, but I missed my pre-arranged shuttle connections in Orlando extending an already long travel day, finally arriving at my destination well after 0200 EDT, which is not a pleasant way to start a vacation. I realize Air Canada is re equipping with the 787, but I do not get the gist of repurposing these well used 767-300s to Rouge if their condition reflects poorly upon the brand, which has taken a hit with the cramped seating and reduction in cabin services. One has to wonder if they have plans to replace the older Rouge aircraft. I might add the return flight was via Toronto was on a much newer aircraft ex Hawaiian with an more up to date interior to boot, which left on time. I might consider Rouge again for a short North American jaunt, but would avoid a long overseas flight on apparently old and past their prime aircraft, especially given the comfort levels in Economy. I was fortunate to be in their watered down Business Class upfront on all my flights. These flights represented good value at least on paper, but there are more reliable alternatives out there than an old 767. Flights to Orlando on United via Houston were half the cost of Rouge right up to departure.",Passive

She however tried to put me in another vacant seat, but I declined because I don't want to leave my husband by himself.",Passive
LHR-BAH-KTM. Nice trip with no delays. Food was ok from LHR-BAH with some western style dishes. To KTM food was more Asian which was nice with plenty of drinks rounds.

"  From Austin to Denver First Class on an A320. Check In via the mobile App, which I find is one of the better airline Apps. United Club is Austin has just been changed around a bit, adding more seating with a better flow to it. Some fruit and something to drink and then it was time to board. I like the United's zone lanes, as it tends to help spread things out a bit better. In Zone 1, was the 4th person to board. Comfortable new interior on this A320, Good legroom and snack service, with warm scones once airborne. Watched some videos, again on the UA App and in 2 hours we were landing, with a ontime arrival. Flight attendants and gate agents were all excellent and professional, frequent updates from the cockpit. Overall a really nice morning flight.",Promoter
Was a frequent Sunwing passenger until recently. Booked a flight from Toronto to Punta Cana. An additional stop over in Puerta Plata was added. We were required to deplane while the plane was cleaned. Passengers boarded and after 11/2 hours boarded the plane for the trip to Punta Cana. On the return flight the flight crew failed to give a drinks service coffee and tea was not served and the staff were very rude and inattentive to the passengers. Sunwing was once a great airline but unfortunately things change sometimes for the worse. My wife and I will no longer book a Sunwing flight. Sad but true.,Detractor
"  Perth to Munich via Singapore. This is a review of the flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich on 10th February. The ordeal started in Singapore. While the flight was not marked as delayed, the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines. In general, I question the justification of SQ having a five star airline rating.",Detractor

Cologne/Bonn to London Stansted. Check-in straightforward. Flight delayed by 90 minutes explanation given on board that planned aircraft had been unserviceable and replacement had to be found. Mildly irritating but fair enough. Ticket included a pre-paid snack that consisted of roll with some of the thinnest sliced meat I have ever encountered but what do you really expect these days on a low-cost carrier particularly on a short hop?

By rude responses we would be answered with words such as ""cool"" and ""move"".

"I had a very disappointed and uncomfortable experience flying with SAS and will try to avoid them in the future. Old plane, business class seat is the same as an economy seat and there was even a middle seat as well. Food and services were no better than Asian low cost airlines. I was on business in Zurich and on my return trip, I had to fly back to Vietnam from Zurich via Stockholm with SAS and then Thai Airways to Bangkok and Saigon. My reservation was with Thai Airways and the first problem - I found with SAS was that I could not check-in online even though I found my reservation on SAS website. I was shocked when I board the plane, I was assigned a middle seat in a row of 3 (B737), sitting next to me was two tall and broad build gentlemen. It was extremely tight and uncomfortable and the hot ambient temperature did not help. During take off, I was told (in a rude manner) to wear my jacket and could not even hold it in my laps. The crew did not offer to hang it for me. It was a two and half hour flight, and we were given food in a paper box - it was too uncomfortable to sit still leaving alone trying to eat a meal. One of the crew appeared to be quite pleasant which helped a bit but the rest were very unfriendly. This was the worst business class flight that I had ever flown in my 27 years of flying history. I have little experience with Scandinavian countries but I often think of efficiency, elegance and simplicity about them - SAS Airlines is definitely not what I expected and I hope that they will change for the better other competition will have them for lunch.",Detractor

Barcelona flight average. Worst bit - BA codeshare. Booked BA 2190 find out it's Vueling.

"  Toronto to Gatwick return via Dublin. My lasting impression is that this is a no-frills airline trying to put on a show like they aren't a no-frills airline. Everything was pretty much lack lustre, but they did get us from A to B to C and back again, on time. Positives: The four planes we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. They've got some good and experienced people working for them. We travelled in peak season so the flights weren't cheap, but outside of that time, they are one of the cheaper long haul airlines. Terms and conditions were made very clear during booking and check in. Connection through Dublin was easy and clear if a bit convoluted. Negatives: Pre-flight customer service was poor. Booking and online check in allowed for no seat selections to be made. At no point in the booking/check in process were we able to select seats, which was important to us due to the age and health of the travellers. Only through extended negotiation with contracted check-in staff at airport, who could see our needs, were we able to secure appropriate seats. Which left for a nerve-wracking build up to travelling. Special meal selections were inaccurate from booking - luckily we called up in advance to confirm. Food on outbound leg was good, but they ran out of the chicken option very quickly. Food on the way home was terrible. Entertainment selection is okay. The technology is poor, though. Had to reset my or my companions' screens at least once on each leg. Several functions did not work. Baggage handling is poor. Had a 2.5 hour wait at Toronto for baggage to come through. One lost bag. Despite which party was at fault, it was very poor customer service from Aer Lingus from that point on, with nobody to speak to at the company, and given telephone numbers cutting out upon connection. Seemingly there is no customer service department. Very few representatives on the ground. Would travel with them again given the cost, but with low expectations.",Passive
"  Tel Aviv to Boston via Istanbul. Overall, a very good experience. Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue. Felt much more comfortable on the 10+ hour Istanbul to Boston leg with my back-pack stored above me rather than under the seat in front of me. Also got a great price by ordering the ticket 4+ months in advance, though did have to pay extra for flight insurance.",Promoter
"I flew Spirit out of Philly to Las Vegas during Labor Day Weekend and I have to say this was by far the worst flying experience I've had. There is zero customer service skills among the staff - that and no communication between staff and customers regarding delays. I sat on the runway for a good hour before my friend asks the flight attendant what the delay was about and her response was ""the jet is being fuelled"" funny because there was absolutely no fuel truck in sight. We come to find out there was a mechanical issue with the plane. Where did they get those seats from. I'm by no means a large girl but those seats made me feel large I was unbearably uncomfortable. The seats didn't recline there was absolutely no leg room and the seats were so close together that I could smell the breath of the person next to me. The temperature in the plane was so cold. If you think you're getting complimentary water think again - Spirit Airline nickles and dimes you for absolutely everything including water. $320 round trip from Philly to Vegas seems like a good deal until you add in the $90 for just a carry on and $3 for water and additional costs for any other drink or snack.

They told us the people at BKK where informed so that shouldn't be a problem. So far so good. However when we arrived at BKK nobody was waiting at the gate. We went to baggage claim and asked a Thai Smile employee who told us to report to the Bangkok Airways ground staff. Bangkok Airways staff knew nothing. They didn't understand and the only thing they could tell us was to go to the Check in at departures. After asking for a third time and still getting the same answer (they didn't even warn the check in staff) we ran as fast as we could to departures. Just in time for check in (with only a few minutes to spare thanks to a very quiet check in) we dropped our bags off and went through the security check.

Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down.

"MEL-PVG outbound 26/12/13 PVG-Wenzhou 26/12/13 PVG-MEL inbound 9/1/14. It's not the best airline out there but acceptable for the direct connection to Shanghai and value for money. Timing of flights meant meals were served just after takeoff and just before landing with not much in between (stewardess came around with water 1-2 times in about 5 hours many passengers went to the galley to ask for drinks themselves). Seats not much room but you tolerate that in Economy Class. Inflight entertainment is standard stuff albeit with a focus on Hong Kong movies and Cantopop. The Chinese service industry has still not mastered the art of the ""false smile"" so hostesses can seem surly and over-officious compared to other airlines. English announcements not of great quality which is not really acceptable on an international flight to an English-speaking Western country.

Vancover-Shanghai sector was good with a fairly new plane with seat back screens with AVOD and a reasonable range of films games etc. Legroom was probably above average. Dinner was of poor quality though breakfast surprisingly good. Drinks limited in range. Staff polite but not very communicative. By contrast the PVG-XIY sector was horrendous. Our original connecting flight had been cancelled and changed 3 months earlier this flight (from Japan) was delayed then diverted when fog came in. Told to rebook for the next day but there was mayhem at the desks with limited staff unable to cope with increasingly angry crowds. No hotel accommodation provided.

"  On June 4th, I flew from Raleigh Durham to Orlando on Spirit Airlines. At first I was hesitant, because of what others have said about the airline, but I took a chance! It was my daughter's first time flying so I wanted it to be a good experience for her. I fly frequently for work so it didn't make me no never mind. The entire flight was GREAT! We had the first seats on the plane, my daughter had an exceptional first experience and the attendants were amazing! We were on Flight 321 to Orlando and Mark and Venus were the best. They were friendly, attentive, very professional and made just overall great!",Promoter
"  A wonderful experience with KLM, which is our favourite airline. We booked a city trip from Vienna to Helsinki via Amsterdam with KLM. Everything worked as smooth as it can be. Fast and simple online checkin, on time departures of all four flights, cabin crew amazing. On the return trip, one of the flight attendants continued with us to Vienna and she was happy to see us again and we felt treated really special. The economy class service on KLM's short and medium haul is exceptional, and the shorter legs (VIE-AMS) we were served a tasty sandwich/wrap and hot and cold drinks, on the longer legs (AMS-HEL), we got a hot sandwich and two rounds of drinks. On the return flight they served a regular hot meal (pasta with tomato sauce) and a dessert. Transfer in Amsterdam efficient, arriving to C7 and departing from C8 was really convenient. For all flights, the atmosphere was very pleasant and the crew members looked like they enjoyed their work.",Promoter
"  New York JFK to Brussels. I took a long haul transatlantic flight with them and was not disappointed. The aircraft was comfortable: pillows, blankets, headsets provided and a personal IFE screen with a selection of movies, music, games and EuroNews to keep you occupied during flight. Hot meal was served shortly after a take off and another snack service right before landing. Flight attendants were very professional and never rude. Both flights were on time. The lavatory was clean.",Promoter
"The reviews for Air Canada Rouge weren't good, so was a bit apprehensive when heading home on a Rouge flight (Rouge was the only option for the Dublin to Toronto return flight). We flew Economy (Dublin-Toronto) and it was a great flight. The flight attendants were friendly and smartly dressed. The interior cabin fabric seemed new. The seats weren't too roomy but they didn't feel too small either. The meals were standard fare for my family, decent, although my vegetarian meal (an Indian vegan dish) had to be the best meal I've ever had on any Economy flight, domestic or international. We were pretty much on-time departing and arriving. The in-flight entertainment was a bit laughable, but we had read up on it and knew that going in. It was funny to see such old Hollywood movies available on the Rouge Player (one of the movies was Never Ending Story!). I am a big fan of world movies and some of the world movies were the same as the ones on the Air Canada flight we took to London when we left on our vacation. Our family would definitely try another flight with Rouge again.",Promoter
"  Flew Athens to London Heathrow with Aegean Airlines. Excellent inflight service, smiling and efficient cabin crew, flights on time and a very clean cabin.

This was the only available flight returning from New York to Heathrow after the hurricane. BA cancelled our flight and couldn't give us another until a week later. The airline was fine although I wouldn't choose to fly with them again staff were fine plane good and it set off on time. Downside was the other passengers who did not understand air safety. One woman got out of her seat when the plane was climbing and children didn't seem to want to wear seatbelts. Other than that and it costing Â£8000 for 5 of us it was fine.,Passive
Honolulu to Los Angeles and a full red eye flight. The hard working crew were gracious and seats up front most comfortable. I passed on the meal so I could relax and enjoy the IFE.

So having written a critical review of a trip to Male from London Heathrow in September 2014 I now have to be fair and balanced. Was nervous when best business class fares by far LHR-BKK came out on OS particularly with an exceptionally tight connection of just 30 minutes in VIE. Usual chronic Heathrow delays meant serious chance of missing connection but OS pulled stops out met us and guided us to the gate - shortest transfer I've ever done on the ground for just 15 minutes. Business class service absolutely faultless on both sectors with some seriously outstanding crews - return flights equally efficient. Well done Austrian you have restored my faith and will now be more comfortable flying you again.,Promoter
"I just returned from a trip at Myrtle Beach today and I want to express my gratitude to the flight captain. The flight was delayed by 4 hours because of a call off from a flight captain in Myrtle Beach. Spirit Airlines was able to find a flight captain who flew out of Chicago to take us back to Latrobe. If the captain had not offered his services, I would have been stranded in Myrtle Beach and would have had to drive the 10 hours back home. We also received a lunch voucher from Spirit Airlines for our inconvenience.",Passive

"Flew Finnair from Nagoya to Helsinki. A not fully booked A340. Managed to switch seats to one with a bit more legroom, the one I initially was assigned to was a bit cramped (and I am not that tall) with some kind of PSU taking up valuable space under the seat in front of me. Nice, hard working and friendly cabin crew. The food was very poor. Some kind of bland pork with rice, cold noodles and some green tea pudding. Being situated in the back of the aircraft they had ran out of options when it was my turn, but I doubt the other choice were any better. Second dish was even worse. Some fried rice balls. Not sure if the Asian caterers are up to scratch. IFE was kind of limited with very few interesting titles.",Passive

When I boarded I was offered welcome drinks before takeoff. The plane was clean, and I had booked a good seat. The meal options were very good. Both flight and ground crew were very professional and very warm. There was cabin WiFi with a good speed. I was charged US$21.95 for that which lasted the entire flight. Garuda Indonesia have improved the IFE, but music is definitely far behind.

Flew Alaska MCI to SEA return in First. Both legs were pleasant but the service on the outbound leg got off to a slow start with no pre-take off beverage offered. However once we were in the air the flight attendant was very quick to begin beverage service. Seats were comfortable but the pitch was a little tight I wish Alaska would invest in some bigger planes for their longer cross country flights in order to have a larger First Class cabin. Food was very good served plated and fresh. Check In both in Kansas City and Seattle was extremely easy and the Board Room in Seattle was pleasant. For a full fare ticket it wasn't an overall bad experience but felt that I overpaid slightly for what I got. Will fly Alaska First again in December and am looking forward to gaining elite status with them. Their mileage earning partnerships cannot be beat and I love that I can fly Delta American British Airways and Emirates as needed and still earn miles.,Promoter
"  Before booking my flight from Atlanta to Chicago with Spirit I checked reviews and there was 98 percent bad and 2 percent good. I was very hesitant to book, but I did and have no regrets. Spirit is upfront at the beginning that your ticket includes you and 1 small personal item. I see so many people complaining about no inflight entertainment, and paying for food? What? It's a flight, not a all inclusive resort. It's intended to get you to and from your destination.

Flight 1914 on May 22 from Toronto to Barcelona / Flight 1915 on June 4 from Barcelona to Toronto. Onboard I began to look for the headphone plug and I was shocked to find out that there is no entertainment system available.â€¦No TV movies or music for a flight that is over 8 hours long. Only option was to rent an iPad and connect to the plane's WiFi but what do you do when you travel with all your family? You rent many iPads? Moreover what happens when your battery is empty again you are left with nothing to do but sit in the uncomfortable limited space that you have. Other bad points for Rouge on the flight back the overhead light was not working so we could not even read a book. Rouge does not offer individual climate control so if you are too hot there is nothing you can do to get a little more air. The crew wasn't so good they seem very disorganized and service was bad. When the meal service got to us we had no choice. We got our beverage long after the meal and again they ran out of a lot of selections. I would accept a lot of those inconveniences for a short/medium length flight but I cannot accept such conditions for long flights. Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was a disaster and I would never recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. And I will do all I can to avoid it in the future.,Detractor
"Dubai to Vienna, a night flight. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable, especially if you desire to sleep during your flight.

Flew from Johannesburg to Zurich on A340. Didn't have pyjamas in my size on board. The cabin is very dated when compared to the new Swiss First on A330. The seat was very uncomfortable fully reclined as it is not completely flat (the backrest still extended slightly outwards and the mattress cover they provide is not thick enough to iron out all irregularities). When I ordered a coffee in the morning I had to remind flight attendant again ca. 10 minutes later. The cabin was full and the one small bathroom was crowded in the morning with people changing again. I would not recommend the First class product on A340. I also wish the Swiss crew would loosen up a bit more. They come across as very uptight when compared to the Lufthansa crew who often seem happy to serve you.,Passive

Milan Malpensa-CPH Friday evening flight around 75% load factor A320 with the new Recaro slim seats SAS will be installing on the new aircraft's on order - great ones - more room for your legs. The best cabin crew I have had on a SAS flight: professional smiling (the biggest improvement maybe) delicate. Same applies on the way back Copenhagen-Milan Linate Sunday late evening flight. Flew on a new A319 100% load factor. Unfortunately no Recaro seats here yet but very good cabin crew 2 young ladies an older one and a steward. Inflight entertainment not existent. One black note: water coffee tea are still free of charge on all SAS European flights in Economy but its quite sad to see that you are asked to pay an extra for sparkling water.,Passive
Flew LGW to Agadir and returned Marrakech to LGW. Had not used them for a few year. Seat allocation makes the difference.

"AF 522 CDG to Cape Town 2/2/15. Service diabolical seat uncomfortable food and beverage very average - all in all the most underwhelming of experiences just like BA in their nationalised period. The most extraordinary experience was to be told by 2 stewardesses over an hour between them to put out my reading light and go to sleep. 58 years ago aged 6 I might have accepted it but how utterly inappropriate behaviour. The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque ""go away and leave me alone"" from me. This stunned her into saying ""you can't speak to me like that"" to which I responded ""I have now go away"". When did it become company policy for AF to treat customers like 6 year olds? Probably the most unsatisfactory flight I've ever taken.",Detractor
Recently returned from Melbourne via Singapore. The seat on the trip from Singapore to Manchester was really uncomfortable as a result I have a bruised coccyx which is still painful.

ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.,Passive
To be fair Spirit warns you that it is a bare bones on the cheap airline. it is the Greyhound of the sky and proud of it. My flight was delayed 7 hours due to the crew not showing up to the fly the plane. The worst part about it though was the fact that I arrived at the airport 10 hours early to try and get an earlier flight. when I checked in they informed me of the delay. They knew of the problem 10 hours out and did nothing. I gave up the fight because this was an experiment to see if it would be worth using them again. Obviously you really get what you pay for. However about 40 passengers where loud enough to get someone manager? to try to calm the situation. She then spent 30 minutes flipping back and forth between excuses what she could do to help and what not. in the end she informed everyone that they could cancel their flight for a 150 dollar fee or get comfortable. It is unfortunate there is not recourse the passenger have in a situation like this. Again the airline knew 10 hours in advance of the problem and just did nothing. Just a live and learn situation. did get a 7 dollar meal voucher. Got me a large water for $7.50.,Detractor
"NH802 on 12 Jun 2016, served by a 77W (Boeing 777-300ER). As this was a codeshare flight with UA, and my ticket was under UA, I had to check-in under ANA since this was the first leg of my journey, even though subsequent legs of my journey were under UA. However I was unable to do online check-in, and after a call to the ANA call centre they said their system to process check-in for codeshare flights was down. Eventually had to check-in at the airport, and was allocated a middle seat as there were no window or aisle seats left. Didn't seem like a good start to the journey, though so far interface with customer-facing staff (whether call centre or check-in counter) were positive. On board, the middle seat in the middle row on the 77W actually turned out to be perfectly fine, as there was additional space between the two middle seats. This provided more room than the usual middle seat. The in-flight entertainment worked fine and was decent, but could have a wider variety of offerings. The seat-back was fixed, so when you recline your seat bottom moves out instead. Not very comfortable when you ""recline"", but I was not looking to sleep so I was not too bothered. The food was good (I had the Japanese meal - why not, since I'm flying a Japanese airline), and the service by the flight attendants were fantastic (always with a smile, very polite, and intuitive). I was particularly amused when I was taking photos out of the window on the cabin door in-flight, and a flight attendant offered to take a photo ""of"" me - she actually meant to help me to take a photo of myself, as she thought I might be interested to take a photo. I appreciated her initiative in anticipating customer's needs, despite the initial misunderstanding. Towards the end of the flight, candy was served, together with postcards for those who love memorabilia. Overall, the food and service were the stars of the show. Flight took off and landed on time.",Promoter

" Singapore to Denpasar. This was my first time flying KLM World Business Class. The flight left slightly later than scheduled due to the late arrival of the aircraft. This flight is a 5th freedom flight from SIN to DPS as the flight originated in AMS. I was In seat 1A and was very impressed with the seat. Highly adjustable to whatever position you want. There is power available to charge your electronics. The seat was a little dirty but I put this down to it not being the first flight and the tight turnaround, nothing abhorrent. The only downside is the immovable ottoman footrest. If you are under 5'7â€ you may struggle to reach it. The inflight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies and tv shows as well as an interactive map showing you the route. It was much more responsive than other IFE systems that I have used recently and the remote is touch screen which helps a lot. The food was respectable for such a short flight, with two choices for the main, either chicken or beef with all the trimmings. Altogether when the salad and desert it was very tasty and the crew kept filling up drinks and offering bread rolls. I was surprised to get a meal on this flight but I was glad I did. The crew themselves were very happy which was pleasant and they were very attentive. The KLM houses were a unique experience as no other airlines do this. I got house number 28 and it is filled with a Dutch Gin. Overall it was a nice flight compared to the competitors on the route and was very well priced for a business product. I would highly recommend.",Promoter
"Flight 1899 on May 9th. The airline might be marketing this as low cost but it is certainly low cost for them and not the passengers. I got ""rouged"" on a ""business"" flight from Las Vegas and thought for a second I was on Ryanair or Air Berlin. In business they took the Lufthansa short haul idea of simply blocking the economy seat off next to you. The flight attendant told me after we took off that I would need an app on my phone (how can I get that in flight?) and then halfway through the flight offered me an iPad to use after I complained this was pretty silly. It wasn't cheaper it wasn't good it was all around terrible. I guess it helps AC make their sales number but it sure doesn't help the passengers in any way. Maybe if it was 50% less than what it is now it might be worth a look. Steer clear!",Detractor
Flew yesterday back from Rio GIG to Madrid on the A330 with new business seats. As it was a night flight I was looking forward for this experience. I have to admit that these seats though lie flat are not comfortable especially as they are narrow and you keep bouncing on shoulder level to the plastic frame. At foot level the space is also limited and you can not move your feet freely when in a lie-flat position. Once again in middle seats you end up touching your neighbour so only recommended when you know each other. Service was again very good from the entire team with meal service done in about one hour allowing to go to sleep soon. Food was good and wines excellent. Landing in Madrid ahead of schedule baggage with priority tags arrived first but 40 minutes after landing.,Promoter
I've flown Emirates over a period of ten years and I can comprehensively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Emirates pitch themselves as being a top-top airline and to a degree the service they offer on paper is quite comprehensive. Their route network is very good and their fares at times can be competitive however the last four long haul flights I've taken with Emirates progressively gets worse. The cabin staff seem disinterested in providing a first class service to the nonchalant ground staff in Dubai. They are cutting back massively on quality they've stopped handing out comfort packs for flights the food is getting worse and the cabin crew don't respond to calls made from your chair. I can give quite a few examples of bad service travelling with Emirates over the last few trips however it was compounded by a poor experience travelling with an infant recently. I've always looked forward to flying with Emirates and I have quite a few Tier Miles and Skywards miles however I feel I've flown my last flight with Emirates.,Detractor

The aircraft was Embraer 90, which offers very comfy seats in business class. Overall impression was spoiled by poor onboard service from a female purser: cold and unfriendly welcome, despite on time boarding no pre flight drinks, not addressing passengers by names, rushed service etc. Meals orders collected (""beef noodles or snacks"" - looks like it is a standard now on this route regardless of time of day). It is mandatory for FAs on China Southern flights to ask passengers whether they would like to be woken up for meals in case of falling asleep but it was not the case on this flight. I fell asleep indeed and woke up on landing announcements. Requested the meal, the purser reluctantly served it saying ""you have to be quick!"". Noodles turned out to be dried out on top and very greasy under, so I just stayed hungry after finishing nuts, yoghurt and fruit.

"  Flew London Heathrow to Beijing via Moscow. My only reason to write this review is to warn other Skyteam members not to fly with Aeroflot. From booking to flight, aside from the planes being relatively new and a lower price than the poor standard Chinese airlines there is no other reason to fly with them. Despite being a Platinum member I was unable to book any economy comfort seats nor even an exit seat, they are all blocked for Aeroflot members only - and on the London to Moscow leg all the exit seats were empty and we were not allowed to move to them. On the 9.5 hour Beijing leg there are no extra legroom seats as they are only available on the 777's, so you are on an aircraft that most airlines use on medium haul with only 30 inches legroom - the cabin was crammed with people all over the place and as normal rather large people at that with legs in the aisles. Check-in was supposed to start at 7.40 but we waited until 8am whilst listening to the staff stories about the night before whilst they drank their coffee, the start of abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey. Flight left 1 hour late and then at Moscow was delayed again by 1.15 whilst they de-iced the wings. The food was not only poor it was inedible, and I had the same AVML meal on both legs plus no alcohol at all, and when questioned all I got was a curt ""we never have any"" reply. Why on earth not? There is no religious reason on flights to China and even China Eastern has 2 bottles of red and white. Lounges were typical Eastern European, absolutely packed and with no hot food whatsoever, I managed to find some coleslaw and sweet bread plus some Chilean wine to keep me going as I'd eaten nothing for over 6 hours. Entertainment system was zero on the flight from London, not even a communal TV nor any music, and on the Beijing flight it kept breaking down. At no time did any staff walk around with drinks, there are no snacks available not even noodles and if you press your call button they do not answer.

I've been travelling with SA for many years each year a trip from UK to Australia via Singapore some years 2 trips. In addition I've travelled with them from UK to Indonesia via Singapore many times. I think I've been to Singapore around 90 or so times. I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty. (I look respectable honestly!).,Passive
CWL-DUB and DUB-CWL flight EI3291 29/10/13. Outbound - The flight attendants always had a smile and were very helpful throughout. The only negative thing about the outbound flight was that there was a mother that did nothing but shout at her kids from the moment we took off until the moment we landed and when your flight is at 8.30 in the morning it's the last thing you want. Inbound flight DUB-CWL flight EI3298 31/10/13 - we left Dublin later than scheduled due to the fact there was a technical fault with a light in the cockpit and could not take off until it was solved. Within minutes engineers were onboard and both the captain and flight attendants kept us up to date with what was going on and reassuring us that everything was going well. The flight attendants on the inbound flight were much friendlier and talkative which is a great thing to have on an airline.

My wife is Japanese so there was no language barrier. ANA agents kept moving us from counter to counter to check in! It was ridiculous. Finally when we got to the counter it took me about 15 minutes to check in due to the novice agent. Immigration line long but moved fast. Aircraft was spotted close to active runway. However we took off late due to ""airport congestion"". Aircraft was starting to show it's age as as the nose had paint coming off. Not something you would expect to see on ANA. Inside cabin was clean and fresh. Cabin attendants continuously smiled the entire flight. Standard ANA onboard service. I sat on seat 42D. I'm 72inches tall but I had plenty of legroom and the seat was comfortable. IFE wasn't that bad. Lunch was really good. I had the connoisseur selection. Cabin Attendants made continuous drink rounds through the meal service. Seat was comfortable that I slept from Sakhalin to Hudson Bay. Snacks drinks U.S. Entry Documents and 2nd meal were all distributed in a nice manner. Landed in JFK late but immigration wait wasn't that bad. My luggage took forever to arrive on the carousel. Over all the ground experience was really bad but onboard ANA lived up to their high standards. I will be flying them again.",Promoter
"Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by Delta's first class service from Lafayette to Montego Bay via Atlanta. Our LFT-ATL flight was operated with a Boeing 717 that appeared to be new inside, but was in fact a refurbished aircraft. The flight attendant greeted us warmly and professionally. There were pillows, blankets and bottled water at every seat in first class. On time departure and arrival. It would have been nice to have been served a hot breakfast snack on this 6:00am departure",Promoter
"I have now flown return from Perth to London Heathrow via Dubai with Emirates on two separate occasions, and each trip has been poor. My expectations had been high which is perhaps why each trip has been a disappointment. I have encountered long delays in flight departures waiting on the tarmac on at least half of the legs flown as flights seem to seldom leave on time. The cabin staff are unfriendly and the entertainment selection is the worst I have encountered. You are hard pushed to find a film title you even recognize in the list of new releases. On two occasions my meal choice has been unavailable (despite being seating fairly close to the start of service) and obtaining a drink (water not alcohol) outside of the allocated service times is as if you have asked for the moon on a stick. Meal quality is however pretty good. Seats are generally comfortable and provide ample space for a long haul flight. I have only flown Emirates as Qantas does not operate its own flights out of Perth and I wish to maximize my QFF benefits by flying on a code share flight.",Detractor
" An early flight from Orlando to MIA. Check in went smoothly. As we had fairly heavy baggage, the check in staff was really helpful to advise us as to what to do to save money and at the same time adhere to airline policies. All worked ok. After a fairly strenuous TSA check went to departures hall and took the shuttle to the gate. Boarding procedure went ok, even though despite of our seat numbers were called last again. Staff were very helpful and courteous at the gate and on board. The cabin was clean. Just a bottle of non-spring water was offered, which we did decline. A fine flight, departing and arriving on time with staff being efficient. Only downturn is the airline's policy on luggage and staff uniforms that look aged.",Passive

" London to Yangon via Beijing. I made the mistake of reading the reviews about Air China after I'd booked my flights, and I was therefore a little apprehensive about travelling with them. I'm pleased to say that my experience was quite different and I needn't have worried! The flights from London to Beijing were operated by a newer 777 aircraft and the seats were surprisingly comfortable and the aircraft interiors were clean. The Beijing to Yangon flight was operated by a 737 aircraft and the interior seemed a little tired. I'd recommend checking the aircraft type before booking as spending over 5 hours on a 737 aircraft was a little uncomfortable. In terms of onboard service I was impressed by the quantity and quality of food and drinks provided. On all legs a drinks service was followed immediately by a meal and then another drinks service. The food was quite tasty, and on one occasion I even got a cold beer (a rarity on Chinese airlines!). While onboard staff can be abrupt, there does seem to be a genuine attempt being made to be helpful and to provide good customer service. From my experience, this appears merely to be a cultural difference, rather than being rude as such. As others have mentioned, the entertainment system isn't the best, with a very limited number of both Western and Asian films. On both the outward and return legs I had 7 hour layovers in Beijing. I'd recommend that passengers bear in mind the long queues and security checks when transferring to other international flights at Beijing which took over 1 hour on this occasion. I've noticed other reviewers laying blame on Air China for this (I had exactly the same experience when transferring at Beijing with China Southern Airlines on a previous occasion). While you might be able to make it through security if you have a short connection, your luggage may not be so lucky, and it would also be extremely stressful. Based on my experiences, I'd say Air China is superior to China Southern in terms of seat comfort, onboard service and catering",Passive
"I just returned from a a month long trip throughout east Asia with the major part of trip - across Canada to Vancouver and then across the Pacific with Air Canada. I have done this trip many times in the last few years but this year was particularly bad. I am a tall person and the tiny regional jet to Vancouver was bad enough with cramped seating and small overhead storage but the long haul across the Pacific was particularly uncomfortable. Clearly AC can order their planes with the seating configs they prefer so with 40-50 seat rows they can easily squeeze in another row in by trimming off a 1/2"" from each row making leg room just that little bit less. Heading out from Vancouver the food was decent but the movie selection was pretty poor. No major current releases and a lot of older stuff. As a result of travelling extensively in the Asia region I must have been on 6 or 7 airlines and when it came time to head home to Canada I had plenty to compare Air Canada to. When it comes to national carriers like Egyptair (Jakarta to Bangkok) or Thai Air (Bangkok to Shanghai) Air Canada doesn't even come close. On the return flight to Canada the plane was an older B767 with the same cramped seating as before. When I checked out the movies they were the same ones that were listed over a month earlier. This time the food was really bad. I usually eat what the airlines provide given it was such a long trip but this time I had to push it away unfinished. Somewhere during the night they passed out some tasteless sandwich rolled up in a plastic wrapper. It is shameful for Canada's national carrier not to have the best on such a crucial route for international business. I expect to be making this trip again and I will make every effort to make my connections with another carrier.",Detractor
HKG-DXB-MXP (Malpensa Milan) in Business Class - my first experience with Emirates and an excellent experience overall. Superb service food and wine.

"Chicago to London return, both flights basically the same as this LHR-IAD sector, with the exception of a fully functioning in-flight entertainment system. Check in with United in London is at its worst average and usually much better. I swear Heathrow has the best ground staff in the entire United system. Was informed the Star Golds now when access to fast track security which is used. It is a very long walk to the United Club but I was prepared for that. The United Club in London is tops and with great staff. The plane was a typical old Boeing 767 that United flies between London and Chicago. While old, it is fairly comfortable in Economy Plus as long as you aren't big into watching video. The screens are small with poor resolution and the sound for the video wasn't working on this flight. Still, all was set up with fresh pillows and blankets and the plane was clean. The thing that made this trip even better was that the economy cabin was empty. My guess is there were 25 of us in back with the front two cabins almost full. The lunch was decent though the portions were quite small. I don't like the pre-landing snack so I always bring my own food onboard for that meal. Flight attendants were friendly. In fact, everyone in Economy was in a good mood that day and, who wouldn't be with all of that room. We were delayed in London due to traffic and weather. Arrived in Chicago having made up about half of the delay. Baggage was out in a very acceptable amount of time. I do this route a fair amount and it is usually one of United's best. Much of that has to do with the London ground staff which is often exceptional and some of the flight attendants who routinely work this route. Fly this route four or five times a year and people will start to recognize you. I am no fan of the new United and this flight isn't quite as much of a joy when full but flying this route tends to be one of the better experiences when traveling on the new United.",Passive
"Seattle to Maztalan via Los Angeles. Flight to Maztalan was delayed 1.5 hours due to having de ice plane.

Pretty decent flight and then that evening I got a note promising a certificate of $75 off a future flight in a few days - that was 6th December, now its the 22 December and zip. Had a great time in Mexico, then the flight out of Mexico was delayed for no reason. We were able to upgrade to exit row#6. One thing I have noticed with carry on is some people that board first to the back rows are putting their carry ons in first overhead bins, I assume to avoid dragging their luggage up row while exiting - but then no room in overhead bins for people in rows behind first class. We landed in LA, sat on plane for 45 minutes while exit door was worked on only to be told we would be exiting from back of plane. OMG the people in back rows that put their bags up front now had to work their way up front to get their bags! No wonder people go insane.

"  It would seem to me that Emirates have spent all their money on advertising and celeb associations while overlooking the upkeeping of their planes or training their staff. My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto. You would be wrong though, we were rebooked onto a flight the next morning, so 45 people on the London flight alone were stuck in Dubai for a full day. Again, staff were slow taking more than an hour to process the 10 of us in the queue.",Detractor

Flew with Ryanair for the first time from Alicante to Manchester. I had not printed off my boarding passes for the three of us. I was not able to do this where we were staying. They then wanted 45 euros from each off us to do this. I managed to get to a PC at the airport and do it myself. The queues for check in were like Russian Bread Queues from the 1970's. When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours. It was appalling and could have escalated into something nasty all due to the bad customer service from Ryanair. I also witnessed an elderly disabled passenger become very distressed when she learned she could not take her collapsible walking aid onto the plane even though she'd been told in advance that she could. She became very distressed as she could not walk without it and was not offered a wheelchair. Absolutely appalling treatment. I will never fly with them again terrible customer service.,Detractor

"This was the return leg of our British Airways flight on BA056 from Johannesburg to London Heathrow on 18th January. While the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly, it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody, petulant crew member. She is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. British Airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. Is this really the way BA wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little.

"â   Baltimore to Copenhagen via KeflavÃ­k. I booked the flight with a 3rd party for WOW air which I don't recommend. You should book directly with WOW. Because of the third party WOW will not do anything regarding your booking until the night before the flight when you will finally be granted access to confirm. I read a lot of bad reviews regarding WOW, so I started trying to cancel my reservation and book elsewhere. WOW has a policy that you can cancel with 24 hours with no penalty. But, if you book with a third party they don't honor WOW policy. I paid for a carry-on $54 before the flight and I paid for my seat also. I did not want to be stuck in a middle seat. I did not find the seats that uncomfortable. The thing to do is strictly follow size and weight requirements. I was extremely apprehensive because of the negative reviews. I followed all of the rules and had no problems at all. It is true that you are not offered a beverage or anything, and that you have to have a credit card to purchase anything. The prices of the food was approx. $2 higher than the high prices in the airport. I brought a sandwich, water and juice from the airport which was costly. I would fly WOW again. I was going to be gone for 3 weeks so I needed the extra bag.",Passive
"YUL-YYZ departure did not go well. AC canceled my flight and rebooked me on an earlier flight. This was done with no notice sent to me. The end result is that I nearly missed my flight and managed to make it by running to the gate. To ensure my bag would make the flight, the agent at checking told me to take my bag to oversized. Had I not been traveling at an off peak hour I would have missed my next flight to Taipei and been stuck in YYZ for 2-4 days waiting for room on the next available flight. The cabin was filled with AC personnel, who took up most of the overhead compartment space, making it difficult to find any space. The flight was fine otherwise with polite service from the FAs. YYZ-YUL: Was able to go and standby and to get an earlier flight (which departed late). The connections agent was helpful. At the gate, it was one agent professional and the other miserable and rude. Again, due to off peak travel time, delays and crowding were much better than usual. Flight was full, but FAs maintained a professional approach. As a very welcome surprise, baggage arrived in a timely manner on both flights. Had it not been for AC's error and the resulting stress and discomfort on the outbound flight I would have rated the flights 8.",Passive
Flew on a Boeing 777-200ER (9K-AOB). The aircraft cabin shows its age and IFE exists but is luck whether switched on or not. In my case it was on movies were in a loop system and I was so excited it was working but sadly the audio did not work. There is no point of offering good quality headsets if the IFE audio doesn't work at all. Food was of excellent quality but less portion (Ordered a vegan meal without dairy products). The cabin staff 12 of 13 were only men on this flight and service was just fair and whatever meets with minimum requirements. There is an exception of the occasional friendly crew who is nice and pleasant. Would I recommend it again? Yes! But please calculate your trips so that you fly the newer aircraft and your experience will be pleasant and enjoyable.,Passive
A very pleasant but flawed flight to Dallas. On the plus side a very good lunch good drinks lots of privacy (difficult to see fellow passengers) a very comfortable seat and an excellent crew.

" Flew Iberia from Quito to Madrid. The aircraft was clean and modern. The main course of the dinner was dry and the bread was stale, but the red wine was good, plus we were given real cutlery and not plastic. I would have preferred them to come around with more drinksâ€”I think they only came through once. The breakfast was good but everything was sweet, no savoury option. Flight attendants were friendly, efficient and competent. My biggest complaint is that the in-flight entertainment system was broken for the entire 10-hour flightâ€”luckily I had plenty of books but I would have preferred a couple of movies to pass the time. I really think they should have made sure this was working beforehand. To be fair, they did credit me with Avios points when I complained.",Passive
"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy. A webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated ""first class"" (real classy) but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car.

Before take-off from London a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us.

"Flew (August 24) MCT-AUH-GVA. A320 plane supplied for the MCT-AUH flight was tired filthy and should not be in service without a complete cabin redecoration. Seats were stained carpets filthy and the seat pitch was best designed for circus midgets. We were delayed 30 minutes at MCT with absolutely no explanation in English perhaps one was given in Arabic. In AUH I hurried to my next gate for the AUH-GVA leg of the journey I made the plane which pleased me. The A330 was noticeably cleaner although the seat pitch was still better designed for research monkeys than human beings. After being rushed on board we sat for quite a while until someone from the flight deck finally explained that there had been an oil spill on the airport and that we would be sitting another two hours at the gate until the runway was open again. Being a sound and reasonable man I understood why passengers could not be let off the aircraft again. Water and paper ""hot towels"" were their only attempt at service in 150 minutes? Their first step should have been prompt announcements in both Arabic and English explaining what was happening then informing us that we would be served beverages and that the inflight entertainment system would be turned on. Food served was a joke on this flight - first a snack (late night flight) consisting of awful sandwich rollups with the advice that we would have a ""full breakfast"" an hour before landing in GVA. The full breakfast was tired and ridiculous - nothing approaching a full breakfast anywhere. Upon arrival at GVA I was one of about a half dozen passengers whose baggage hadn't ""made the flight"" despite 150 minutes extra time at the gate. It took three days to get my bag to me. Now let's turn to the return trip flown two days ago from ZRH-AUH-MCT. In ZRH we were boarded promptly and the aircraft another A330 was cleaner than the A330 from AUH-GVA. That sort of tells me that you need to better supervise or replace your cleaning staff at AUH your home airport. The flight was not full so there was room to spread out which many passengers did immediately after ""boarding completed"" was announced. We pushed back with Swiss precision on the dot. Food served was delicious plentiful catered by Swissport/LSG. In AUH I made my way to my departure gate in another Terminal weaving through what have got to be some of the longest walks in any airport anywhere. Luckily here and there were moving sidewalks although these were usually clogged so I was actually worried I would miss my connection in the relatively short transfer time allotted by Etihad of only 70 minutes between flights. I needn't have been worried. After reaching the gate it was again a story of sit sit sit. No explanation. No communication from the airline. Suddenly almost an hour late we were rushed onto the bus to the aircraft. The air conditioning was not on. After 10 minutes of waiting there was a terrific lurch and air conditioning came on. On the (same) plane familiar conditions - filthy tired upholstery dirty carpets ridiculous seat pitch. And again we sat. This time however the captain communicated with us in excellent English. He didn't provide any explanation for the delay but at least gave us accurate estimates of when we would actually take off. And he apologized which surely must have been regarded as unusual by the crew as they seemed shocked when he did so. The only silver lining in this very cloudy tale? This time the delay must have been enough time for my luggage to make the flight.",Detractor

"I've been commuting between RDU to EWR for the past few months. As a loyal Delta flyer I transitioned over to United because they offer direct flights into Newark.

I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges.

Cabin attendants were very attentive. The business class seats are angled and lie down fully flat through I did not take advantage of this feature on such a short flight - the touch controls were easy to use.

Having flown Easyjet since 2005 I can certainly say they have gone downhill. What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair. I will not be looking to fly with them again any time soon if this trend continues!,Detractor

  Flew Manchester to Tel Aviv via Brussels return. The way there was okay besides that we got a small cold snack when we were expecting a warm supper on a four hour flight. On the way back the incoming flight was delayed and there was a further delay leaving Tel Aviv. The cabin crew seemed quite agitated and stressed. We once again only got a snack served. At least we had brought some food along because we doubted we would be served a proper meal. Might as well fly a low cost airline where I don't get a meal served. When I asked one of the stewardesses for a cup of hot water I was told to get it myself in the galley! Another stewardess could not be bothered to help a father who was trying to pick up some food his child had spilled. She just stood and watched. Due to delayed arrival in Brussel doubted I would get my connection to Manchester. Was told by the ground crew to run and you might make it! Why could they not get me there on a Buggy if the plane was specially waiting for me as they made me believe. Lies! Plane hardly waited for us as one of my fellow travellers on the Brussels to Manchester leg told me. Boarding had been delayed on that flight and passengers had just settled down when I came on the plane.

Flew Rouge from Toronto to San Diego and return. Didn't know I was on a Rouge flight I should have paid more attention but then I didn't know what awaited me. What awaited me was the worst flying experience ever. There was no legroom. I rented an Ipad on the way down and was disappointed by the entertainment offering and they ran out of ipads on the return leg. I have been a long time supporter of Air Canada. I have always said that I knew what to expect (a service offering I was satisfied with) and when I got on an Air Canada flight to come home I felt I was home when I boarded the flight. I really have been a vocal supporter of Air Canada. But no longer. We are currently booking flights to Phoenix in January not on Air Canada.,Detractor
" Miami to Manchester via Zurich. MIA airport is slight chaotic, though reasonably smooth check-in and security. Lounge shared with Avianca, it was busy and limited choice of food - not very relaxing, though comfortable and functional. Flight was great! As only five seats in a row, felt quite spacious for business class - a full size seat width right down to your feet. Seat also very comfortable - had what felt like a gel type cushion that you sat on. Slept for 5 hours with no problem - not often I've done that! Great screen - high resolution. Good quality dining - though flimsy trays that FA had to reach over by husband to retrieve. FAs friendly, though required a little prompting. Overall a great long-haul product. Lounge in ZRH, a bit small, though comfortable. Short haul flight okay, catering rather odd and I eat most things. Manchester airport excellent again - from disembarking to car 20 mins - Nice one!",Promoter
" Took a multi-leg trip LTN-ZRH, BSL-AMS and AMS-LTN. On each occasion the flights were late with the delays being 70 minutes, 45 minutes and 2 hours respectively. On board staff were as helpful and apologetic as they could have been, but the impression remains of an airline that has severe organisational and punctuality issues. Information provided via their app and at the airport is inconsistent and unreliable and boarding is not well organised or pleasant with passengers being corralled into enclosures like cattle before boarding and then made to wait for an indefinite amount of time. When fees for seat reservations and hold bags are taken into account the price advantage over legacy airlines is marginal at best. Plus their lack of reliability and poor boarding organisation makes EasyJet a poor choice. If they can improve their on-time performance they might be worth considering otherwise I will give 'TardyJet' a miss in future.",Passive

Me and my wife were travelling to Mexico even upon asking seats were given separately through out our travel.

" Luton to Lisbon. Unfair and dirty money grab practices. At one point, I found myself well ahead of a flight and in the process of checking in. I checked all Wizz Air emails, in which I could not find any check in links, nor did I receive any reminder emails on the matter. I assumed that Wizz Air does not have online check in functionality or it was broken. When at the airport, I got asked to pay the sum of 33 GBP at the airport for failing to online check in. Given the airline's unwillingness to email people about checking in online and having a confusing and poor website UX that does not bring people instantly to the online check in page, reeks to me of a money grab. I reached out to the airline on the matter which not only did not apologize, but also failed to acknowledge any sort of problem and was unwilling to sort this out, which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.",Detractor

Flying out at 0720 on a Sunday and having an early start to get to the airport I was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight.

Freezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep â€“ another example of BA's pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airline. Despite it being one of the first flights out of Heathrow, with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions â€“ we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into Vienna â€“ quite as to how, is beyond me.

Nothing outstanding but everything you would expect or need. Inflight entertainment is alright, a mix of Western and Asian movies. The fleet is not the most modern and in a few occasions the entertainment is not working in some seats. (1 out of maybe 50). I had one damaged bag which I claimed damaged and received 50 euro. On another occasion, my bag did not make the extremely short layover and was sent to my hotel 3 hours later. Air China however does not allow the operation of mobile phones, not even in flight mode!

"I have flown on SW since 1971! It used to be fun when I was a teenager. It is no longer fun. Southwest Airlines has always had open seating. In 1981, before they had Early Bird check in, I flew to Tampa to visit my parents with my 3 year old. There were NO adjoining seats. The only way I got a person to move was to say they would have to take care of my daughter. I quit flying SW! I started back when they started Early Bird. I am quitting SW again. It is truly a cattle car. Like riding the bus in the 60-70's. Both flights I was 49 with paying extra. I got the last aisle seat on that plane. Early bird does not help if you have a continuing flight which most Southwest Airlines flights are. Also too bare bones. Plane was freezing. No blankets. People were rude while waiting for the bathroom. Said don't stand here. Like where are you going to stand? It is not the airline I knew in the 70's.

Cathay only has 6 First class pods on its 777 however there were only 2 passengers in the first class on my flight so the service we got was exceptional. The crew was very attentive and you could see they were trying to make an effort to make our journey as pleasant as possible. Little things like talking to me about my vacations and my job back in London was a nice change to the robotic Crew at the back of the plane in many airlines. Food was very nice. I ordered from the menu whenever I wanted something and the crew was happy to prepare it for me, in addition my drink was always filled up. The bed in Cathay is one of the most comfortable in the industry. While I went to change in to the PJs, my seat had been converted into a bed with an additional mattress on top. Similar while I was changing back into my clothes the seat was re-organised in my absence. The whole experience was very nice, from Check-in till landing. I will highly recommend Cathay if you have not tried it before.",Promoter

I asked for a refund was told no but finally was granted one after ranting and raving. I asked why he didn't stop to help us when I clearly said we were waiting for the flight.

" Auckland to New Delhi via Beijing. Worst experience of my life. Flight took off from Auckland, flew for a few hours, then the pilots realise that there is an engine problem and lands back at Auckland. Then they kept misleading the passengers to wait for an hour, to get the problems solved, but kept delaying more. Eventually we are told to return the next day for the next flight. No compensation provided. No hotel rooms provided. Passengers were stranded from different locations without even knowing if the airline will book further connecting flights or not. No courtesy towards passengers. Rampant language problem. The flight hostess didn't even understand English. We were stranded in Auckland for a day, sleeping in the airport. After returning to check in counter the next day, they didn't take our issue or priority and we were the third last people to get our boarding passes, that too through a different route.

The selection of movies is limited, yes they have some really new movies, but problem is this is limited. It took hour and half before we got our food (were the last one on the plane which was bad luck), food wasn't great, but was ok. Problem are drinks between meals, cabin crew brought drinks only with meals, but not in between. You can go to gallery and pour yourself a drink, but when you have a window seat two people need to stand up and they might be sleeping, it wouldn't kill the cabin crew to walk around with couple drinks. Also boarding was done bit chaotic. At least the leg room was good on all aircraft including A320 and really good on A321 (same as at 777).

Flown 6 flights on BA recently generally satisfied though cost cutting in Business Class seems to have got out of hand. Club Kitchen snacks are shrinking with little left half way through long flights and meals and choice less. Although there are many new business class seats out there that are better BA is still acceptable especially the very private window seats. Crew usually excellent and baggage delivery consistent at terminal 5. My one complaint over these 6 flights would be that no effort is made to control the amount of hand baggage on board even on short flights boarding takes so long while stressed crew are trying to find space for large and heavy bags when some people have two or three large bags each. Two out of six flights were delayed because of this while they offloaded some bags that would not fit. Recent flights with Easyjet have not had this problem they enforce their rules so we all know where we stand.,Passive

"We were switched from AC mainline to Rouge for our flight to Barbados about 4 months before our departure. AC did not notify us of the change and as we were travelling as a family we had booked our seats in advance, long and behold after the switch to Rouge we were all scattered around the plane. After several complaints it is apparent AC could care less, a sentiment echoed across these boards and forums. After reading the horrible reviews of Rouge I was very anxious about the trip. We have two children (8 months and 2.5 years) and I am 6'3"" and was very worried about the leg room and lack of in-flight entertainment. As a result I coughed up the $40 for a premium rouge seat (row 12) and as much as I hated paying extra it was worth every penny. I did have plenty of room for my legs and for my wife and I to tend to the kids with adequate space. Service on-board was quite good, FA's were younger however they were more pleasant than the old crusties I experience all the time with AC mainline. Inflight entertainment is non-existent as mentioned here so either cough up some $ for an ipad rental or bring your own device. Planes themselves are quite old however the interior has been updated and looks quite nice. AC service at the airport is deplorable. We arrived 3 hours before our flight and checked in online the night before. However when we went to print our luggage tags and boarding passes at the kiosk we were informed on screen we had to see an agent. This was due to our infant and AC requiring to verify the passport picture. We were in line for over two hours, yes two hours, with the kids in order to check our bags and see the agent. The line was full of other people who could have easily checked-in at the kiosk and checked their luggage separately. Why was AC not enforcing this? They just let anyone in the line, so what is the point of the kiosks. Anyway I asked two separate AC staff that our plane leaves within the hour and we need to feed the infant before we leave. They could not care less and just said back in line. After all this we made it to the gate with only 15 minutes to spare. I have been flying AC frequently for the past 10 years on business and for leisure, going forward I will explore every option to avoid them and opt for another airline such as WestJet. AC's horrible policies, shady practices of switching to Rouge and just a general disregard for their customers is plenty reason to avoid them. That being said Rouge itself was not as bad as I had thought it would be although we were on the larger 767 and not the airbus.

"London Heathrow-Moscow return with Aeroflot. Paid a small premium for a non-stop flight, and it was worth it as alternative routings are not convenient. Both flights were on time and there was no waiting for luggage. Inflight it was a mixed experience. Legroom and seat width was very decent on both aircraft, and the A330 even has personal entertainment screens although the system is old and very slow to respond - some passengers gave up. The inflight magazine looks great but shamefully except for a few pages it's entirely in Russian. They serve a small meal on this flight, a slighly reduced version of something you'd get on a transatlantic flight with no dessert. Don't expect Russian cuisine, except for the dry Russian bread. Cabin crew could do with a communication refresher course: on the outbound they were welcoming and friendly, but on the inbound they were devoid of smiles, mechanical with military-like efficiency, and I witnessed some shocking behaviour from one crew member who barked at passengers, even shouting ""chicken or lamb?"" six times to an elderly passenger who clearly could not undertand English.

I upgraded with SkyTeam miles (89,900 miles to be precise) from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam (my full itinerary was Santiago de Chile-Edinburgh, but only the previous segment got upgraded). I have been a customer of AF/KLM for well over 10 years, and have never been offered an upgrade or anything, which I believe says a lot about how they value their loyal customers. For this upgrade, I had to repeatedly ask the purser on Santiago-Buenos, then ground staff, before finally getting an answer! Which is still better than when you ask on Messenger or WhatsApp, and they just say 'no' without any kind of explanation--this also needs improving. Anyway, preamble over and onto the product itself. I was in seat 1 C, which had a not very charming view of a corridor leading to the flight deck, past the kitchen etc. There was also some foot traffic around here. There are only 2 toilets for the whole of Biz class on this plane, this is too little as there were queues, and also the toilets are no different from Economy, I believe they should have special touch to justify the increased cost.

Took a flight from Toronto to Las Vegas yesterday. Scheduled departure was 8.40 am. At 9.00 they announced they were a bit behind and a plane was being towed to the gate. 45 minutes later still no plane and an announcement we're delayed to 10.30. At 10.30 an announcement they're still waiting on an aircraft and we can present our boarding pass to a few restaurants in the terminal for up to $10 worth of food and drinks. At 11.30 a plane arrives and we get boarded by 12. At which point they announce that the pilot and co-pilot have logged too many hours and we are waiting on a new crew. The new pilot arrives by 12.30 and tells us our plane was delayed because it had to be tested after getting overnight maintenance. She announces the co-pilot will be there soon. At 1.00 they announce that they need to reboot the computer system and we will be leaving shortly thereafter. By 1.30 the co-pilot and everyone seem accounted for but wait! We now have used so much fuel we need refuelling. We finally got underway at nearly 2.15 after waiting to refuel. This airline is a complete joke. As a Canadian I am embarrassed that they call themselves our national airline. All of these delays occurred after being forced to wait in Pearsons 'cattle pen' lounge for getting into Customs. We finally left at the same time we were scheduled to land. Numerous people on board missed connecting flights but the crew didn't seem to care. As an aside the crew seem very young and inexperienced and not well trained in how to handle these extreme flight delays with customers. If I could assign zero stars I would.

"Madrid to Los Angeles via London Heathrow. Smooth departure at MAD and LAX and transfer at Heathrow. Lounges at Madrid Barajas T4 and Heathrow T5 excellent, but overcrowded and a bit frayed at the edges at Los Angeles. No problems with baggage or delays. The Boeing 767s used between London and Madrid are so old they're almost retro, with LED screen TVs and blue leather seats, but comfortable, spacious and clean. The A380s seemed almost new, the seats are a little narrow but comfortable, and the inflight entertainment is excellent. Good amenity kit and simple but good quality food. It's nice that they serve traditional British things like brunch and afternoon tea, and they offer excellent wines and drinks.

"We flew Qantas from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai (QF1) in Economy. Had flown from Brisbane to catch this flight and arrival and transit were perfect. Boarded in Sydney easily and left on time. We had window and middle seats, and aisle seat was occupied. Seat was average economy in regards to comfort and leg room - didn't expect anything different. Was able to sleep on and off the whole way to Dubai. The A380 is such a quiet and smooth plane. Have done several flights to LAX on the Boeing 747, and this is so much quieter. (Do prefer the 747 though for seat comfort and legroom though). The crew to Dubai were excellent - service was efficient, cheerful and nothing seemed to hard. Our meals were all quite tasty and we weren't left feeling hungry. Drinks were offered regularly, and wines, coffees, soft drinks were all available. Empty trays were quickly removed. Definately give that sector 5 stars. Dubai to Heathrow sector was different. The crew were welcoming and happy, but the service once in the air was not as good as previous flight. Meals were still good, but slow in coming and not quite hot enough. No wine was offered at all on this flight (which would have made the remaining 7 hours flying time more relaxing and helped sleep a bit more). Breakfast was brought around when we started descending which we thought was not well planned. Felt like we had to rush so trays could be removed before landing. No second coffees were offered - after nearly 27 hours in the air, another beverage would have been appreciated. This crew just didn't seem to be as efficient as previous crew. Would still fly Qantas when possible as we have found that the majority of flights and crew are efficient, professional and cheerful.",Promoter

To my surprise, a very well organized boarding procedure by TGS at the gate with recorded announcements offering priority for passengers needing assistance and premium flyers. The A321 with the recliner business seats and the touchscreen IFE (including the handheld controller) offers good comfort for a flight that is shy of 4-hours. Pre departure drinks offered with a smile by the Flying Chef. The amenity pouch handed out also adequate considering the duration of the flight. The onboard catering of high quality.

"This was my return flight from Las Vegas to Toronto on August 10, 2015. Flight 1854. I have a severe anaphylactic peanut/nut allergy. Just over a week before I travelled, I contacted Air Canada to inform them. Upon baggage check-in and gate check-in I also informed the airline. As I entered the aircraft I informed one of the flight crew. The main question that was asked of me at each check-point was do I carry an epipen and if so how many. This crew, as well as the crew travelling to Las Vegas on Flight 1853 (Toronto to Las Vegas) on August 5, 2015, did an excellent job. The crew on the first flight did assure me that even though they usually provide peanuts to the first class/business class cabin, that they would not be serving those at all on this flight. A member of the flight crew on this first flight did approached me and the rows behind, next to and in front of me about a peanut-free zone. The crew on the second flight made a cabin announcement as part of their safety demonstration that they would not be serving peanuts/nuts on this flight and that one passenger has a severe allergy and that the passengers should refrain from consuming any such food. This was the first flights in a long time that my allergy was treated with respect and professionalism. I took the advantage of boarding the flights early to wipe down my seat and tray table and to set up my area with a blanket, but that is a great feature and something that I will request upon further travel.",Promoter
Auckland-Guangzhou-New Delhi return in economy. The positives: The Auckland-Guangzhou part of journey in the air was good. Food beverage and inflight entertainment was acceptable for the price you pay. The airplane is modern and the seats have a little leg rest in economy. The Negatives: 1. On my AKL-CAN-DEL journey my flight to Delhi was cancelled due to bad weather. From here the airline ground staff could have been courteous and helped us through the process of passing immigration and customs so we can take bus to hotel. But no they weren't. They treated us with disdain and were very rude. A guy with very little English told us to follow him as we navigated the airport from gate to bus via customs and immigration. The food they served was awful. The airline kept all passengers uninformed as to when the next flight was. Once I got to the airport the airline gave us boarding passes for 7am flight. Once I arrived at gate I was told that it was actually for the 11am flight. During the 5 hour wait we were lucky to get water and food from the airline. Flight delays occurs for many reasons its how the staff handle them from then on that makes the difference. 2. The planes from Canton - Delhi - Canton were old and had no inflight entertainment. In summary I would not fly with them again.,Passive

We flew Geneva-AUH-Phuket and back in Economy over the Christmas holiday. The flights to Phuket were pleasant on time and smooth. Service is pleasant food is good and seats are cramped but not more than on other airlines. The way back was less smooth as the flight to AUH was delayed 5 hours due to fog in AUH and we missed our connection. Luckily we got another connection that left AUH to Geneva (also delayed) with a 6 hour transit. While I find Etihad a good airline the problem is the AUH airport. Almost all flights are served by buses there are not enough toilets and the food court offers average food. Also the fact that one needs to stop in middle of the night in AUH instead of going direct exposes the travelers to risks of delays and long transit times. Etihad is still far away from competing with Emirates and needs to focus on having a top quality airport which can handle all its passengers comfortably and fix the systems so that some simple fog does not shut down its airport!,Passive

  Flew three sectors in total with AirAsia. Booked online and checked in online well in advance. We were not seated together but expected to pay a fee to be seated together for two of the sectors. I booked 30 kgs of baggage as there is no free allowance for all three sectors but they only allowed me 20 kgs and wanted extra excess baggage fee. Their scales at KBV registered 5kgs more than the scales at DMG. Seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. Stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how I was feeling. Safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. Money before safety. Third sector was late departing but no apology. There are cheaper alternatives if you look around. I am a regular flyer and this was possibly one of the worst experiences.,Detractor
" Denver to Vancouver. Just want to commend an employee who provided excellent service, the likes of which I haven't seen for a while. There was a mom sitting in front of us with two children, one of whom wasn't behaving well. He had some kind of device playing a game that was really annoying for the rest of us and the stewardes politely but firmly said he couldn't remain with the sound on but she would get some headphones. The plane wasn't completely full and once we had taken off, the stewardess gave a few passengers the option to switch into other seats to make this flight a little more comfortable. She did it in a well managed way. The stewardess then brought the child in front who was still having problems something to amuse him and a treat. He still wasn't behaving well for his stressed mother so the stewardess took him for a walk around the plane to give the mom a bit of a break. She brought him back and continued with her work but then she returned again later, knowing the mother was still in a mini crisis. She took the time to sit with this mom and talk with her, understanding the difficulties she was having and giving her the comfort she needed.

"  Moscow to Hong Kong via Beijing. Moscow SVO Airport terminal 2F is a scary terminal with very rude and not so orderly security process. Boarding was a free for all, no priority given to passengers with special needs, business class or Star alliance high tier members. Air China ground staff did not seem bothered neither as they were chatting with themselves with arms folded watching the mess sorting out by itself. Once onboard, despite the seats looking worn and dirty, the cabin attendants were amazing. Addressing passengers by surname, kneeling down to speak and engaging in friendly but not overly intrusive small talks. The lady noticed I bought caviar and offered some dry ice. Landed in Beijing late and the nightmare restarted. We were greeted by poorly dressed Air China staff, turned out, all Air China staff in Beijing Airport were poorly groomed. They barked out orders only in Mandarin and to other Russians who do not speak the language, they resorted to pushing and pointing to the transfer zone, very long queue to get our boarding cards stamped and when I asked a question to an Air China staff if that was the right queue, she told me 'only sticker, only sticker', so I went off to look for another queue and was sternly turned back by airport security to ask me to rejoin the sticker queue. Turned out what the lady meant was she was there only for people with a sticker (those that had tight connections) and I should not ask her questions. It took over 40 minutes to clear the 'transit boarding pass stamp' and security formalities. Reached the lounge with 50 minutes to spare but was turned away by the lounge agent telling me that the connecting flight was already ready for boarding. It was a lie as after a 15 minute stroll to the boarding gate, it was not for another 20 minutes before boarding commenced. Once on board, the excellent inflight experience returned.

JFK-HKG-CMB 12/18. We purposely like to fly out of JFK to catch Cathay's afternoon non-stop to HKG vs. flying out of LAX (plus get a couple of nights in NYC). Check-in at JFK is with BA. They don't offer any of the special services you find at JAL FC check-in or AA Flagship (an airline employee walks you counter check-in through Security to the Lounge). Priority TSA is not available at the early afternoon hour. Luckily regular security did not have long lines. Cathay uses the BA FC Lounge which is not special and needs a major refurb. The 777-300 had Cathay's new refreshed FC cabin. The flight is so special it makes up for the mediocre airport experience. The FAs are simply the best. Lunch and dinner meal services on this 16+ hour flight can't be beat. The menu has a wide variety of choices. I had the lamb which was perfectly cooked to my requested preference medium rare.

" Saint Louis to Reykjavik. Being the first to book WOW Premium on our travel dates, we did not expect three family members to be bumped down two classes of service â€“ from Premium to Basic â€“ and the other two members to be bumped from Premium to Plus. But, that's what happened two days before departure. How do I know we booked first? Because the seat schematic in premium class was completely empty when we bought tickets 8 months before departure and selected our seats. Plane change was given as the reason, but the real reason was that WOW reconfigured their seats and classes of service, and didn't notify anyone â€“ at least not us. So instead of re-assigning seats according to booking dates or giving you the option of selecting new seats based on an early-booking priority, we were evidently randomly selected to downgrade even though we would have re-booked different dates had we been given more than 48-hours' notice. The same thing happened on the way home. We were again bumped to lower service levels. On the way to Iceland, we at least received a few of the Premium perks, including a â€œmealâ€ that consisted of a 10-inch baguette with two deli-thin slices of ham. But, this time, we were asked to show our receipts to the flight attendants in order to receive the meal and two drinks â€“ one hot and one cold. Yes, that's right, one hot and one cold. And we were informed that if we wanted two cold drinks we would have to pay for one, even if we were to forego the hot drink. Our luggage arrived with us on the flight to Iceland.

They are having scheduling issues flights are late 70-80% of the time. They charge for everything since I have no luggage only a computer bag that's ok. I reserve a seat since I don't want a middle one and that recently went from $3 to $8. All this is ok for a two hour flight (beats driving) except that the plane I have been flying on lately has the thinnest most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on in an airplane.

I've flown with UIA many times mainly HEL-KBP route but also some domestic routes always in economy class. Flights are usually on time. If delayed it's hard to find proper info about the reason.

First off, the seat was horrible, almost like the padding on your back had worn down to metal, the only way to stay comfy was with a pillow behind your back. Then comes the inflight staff! Served by the worst attendant I have ever experienced. Completely rude, barking orders at anyone who didn't comply â€“ quite shocking. All in all the Air NZ experience left me disappointed, after having such high expectations, I certainly wont be choosing them again over the vast options when flying London to NZ again.",Passive
BKK to RGN to BKK: A great choice to fly to Yangon Myanmar with. Their tickets price is cheaper than TG and I am very impressed with their service. Check in has no fuss people with the airline gold card and internet checked in passengers can go to a faster lane. This is especially handy to know for Yangon airport where the check in queues can be quiet long and easily take 30 mins or more. Aircraft is clean in excellent condition and one class only crew are charming and helpful. For a short flight little more than an hour free meals were offered and taste quite good too with metal cutlery not those cheap plastic ones. All in all I am very impressed with Bangkok airways will not hesitate to chose them again for flying to other AESAN countries via Bangkok.,Promoter
" New York LGA to Charlestown. When I booked the trip I paid one price for myself and a higher price for my mom's ticket. I was unhappy to over pay for her ticket and had planned to call for a price adjustment on that. By the time I called I checked the current price and it was $30 less than my original ticket and $80 less than my mom's ticket. When I called to request a price adjustment the lady refused. I think that is a horrible business practice. Southwest would credit me in a minute no questions asked. Instead this lady tries comparing my purchase to buying a pair of jeans at final sale?! It's not a pair of jeans, it's a flight that hasn't even been taken yet! I think it's disgusting to do that and will never fly Delta again as a result! Don't think that is worth the price adjustment!",Detractor
"  London to Seoul via Frankfurt. This was one of the worst flights I have been on. Our plane was delayed due to weather fair enough, but then we were stood on the tarmac for over 45 minutes as they boarded customer who then decided to not fly on that flight so their bags had to be taken off. As the flight was delayed this should of been sorted out earlier as there was plenty of time to do so. We had to get a connecting flight which meant it was going to be close whether we made it or not. However when things settled down, and I pressed the assistance button not 1 member of staff showed up, therefore I had to go looking for help. When I finally asked they were less than welcoming with the vaguest of answers about us making our connecting flight. Luckily we made the flight with minutes to spare. We asked for a snack before our inflight meal but nothing was available. Again staff were not helpful and kept offering us drink which was of no us to use and meant we had gone 8 hours with nothing but a sandwich on the last flight. Upon arrival in Incheon we found out that our luggage had not made it to Incheon. We again were treated appallingly no apology or offer of compensation.",Detractor

On a 3 day trip the flight was delayed a full day for ""mechanical trouble"". We flew back on another carrier and discarded our return Sunwing flight at the time. We tried them again to Cuba this year because our friends had already booked through them. Next time I will try to book anything with Sunwing.",Detractor
Sydney - Hong Kong vv with airbus 330 economy. Inflight service alright. Food very small the main portion was less than 300 ml in capacity. A bit meagre when compared with Qantas meals. Flight attendants very courteous. Seat in front of toilet so didn't disturb anyone when seat reclined. On the return flight congee served which suited the cultural background of most passengers. A choice of 3 meals didn't run out of choice. Sat next to toilet again toilet door didn't shut properly so ended up closing door for passengers most of the time. No 2nd offer of drinks unless on request. This is below par compared with SQ in which each drink is offered twice. Overall a satisfactory product.,Passive
"London City to Granada. I've flown with BA a lot over the years, most recently in Business and First and have, until recently, always had a favourable opinion of them. I recently used Avios to take a short break to Granada with my brother. My normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because I don't believe the extra cost (whether this be actual money or Avios) justifies the perceived benefits. Regrettably, no economy reward seats were available so I opted for Club Europe. The only real benefit on this particular route was the increased baggage allowance, although this was of no real use for a 3 to 4 day trip! So what did we get for our 'business' flights no lounge at City Airport, no fast track at City Airport, a 'holding pen' prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding. Seats in Club Europe are identical to those in Economy. The breakfast going out was terrible (burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant). The lunch (if you can call it that) coming back was also terrible - a cold salad dish with dried out rolls accompanied by vinegary wine. No lounge at Granada, No fast track at Granada, coupled with a single check-in desk most of the time and long queues I complained to BA about this - the initial response was that Club Europe left the middle seat free to allow more room. Whoever responded obviously didn't even think to check the aircraft, as there is no middle seat on the Embraer - it's a 2x2 configuration for the whole aircraft. After some considerable persistence on my part, a partial refund of 5,000 Avios each was provided by British Airways. I recently had the choice of flying Club World to Hawaii (BA to LAX and then AA to HNL) but given the fact that British Airways Club World can be quite claustrophobic, ultimately decided to try out Qatar Airways new business class to Thailand (via Doha) - by all accounts their business class is comparable to British Airways first class. I shall review this some time next year!",Detractor
Lisbon - Zagreb Aug 26th. It was supposed to be a direct flight but at check-in we found out that it was re- routed via Prague with the expected delay of 2 hours to our destination. The fact is that both direct flights were cancelled and replaced with Lisbon-Prague-Zagreb-Lisbon flight. Departure from Lisbon an hour late. Next we were waiting for almost hour and a half at Prague and even after all the passengers from Prague boarded they explained to us that we are still waiting for the luggage of 4 passengers who came on-board late. Finally we reached the destination 3 hours later than scheduled. The snack was poor and despite the duration of the flight was exactly doubled we didn't get any extra service. Nobody really apologized for the situation like that's a normal thing. However I find such policy very inappropriate. After all there were more than enough passengers flying both to Prague and Zagreb no need to merge flights. And not to mention passengers in transit who missed their subsequent connections or trains busses. Finally we decided never to fly with TAP again.,Detractor
MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.,Passive
"We first went to Istanbul in a 4hr flight from Malaga. We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices. Turkish will continue being a good airline whenever they continue with that more or less good relation between quality and money.",Promoter
"Chicago to Amsterdam with KLM. Overall, from checking in to landing it was a poor experience. The food was awful and condescending cabin crew.

"We took the Chennai-Bagdogra flight through Indigo. Booked well in advance under a deal and it is 100% worth every penny. From the ease of web check in to boarding, the IndiGo staff were very friendly. The journey was very comfortable, aircraft relatively new, flight stewardess were very friendly. Flight departure/arrival were on time. During the hop at Kolkata, we were even allowed to visit the cockpit and the captain demonstrated the functionalities. I never expected this kind of treatment, and we were very satisfied overall with Indigo. Even our return journey to Chennai was again with IndiGo, which again is very pleasing experience overall for us.",Promoter
"  Spirit Airlines canceled our flight from Detroit, MI to Denver, CO the night before we were supposed to leave. The only way they notified us was via email which we didn't get until 3am which was an hour before we were meant to leave. It was hard to get ahold of anyone because a phone number was hard to find and the first couple numbers we tried weren't open yet. Once we did get ahold of someone she couldn't understand anything I was saying. Very irritating when you are trying to find a resolution quickly. The only resolution she did find for us was as a flight two days after our original flight was. And they didn't offer to help us find a sooner flight with a different airline. We ended up having to drive 18 hours across the country because our returning flight wasn't with spirit therefore we couldn't get a refund. Every single part of this situation was awful and I will never fly with Spirit again.",Detractor
"EY306 Kuwait to Abu Dhabi. Despite all the hype around Etihad being one of the top-tier Gulf carriers, I was surprised to find it to be woefully lacking on this short sector of 1h 55m. There was no drinks service at all in economy. This meant that two hapless flight attendants were asked randomly by passengers for drinks. It was hard for them to remember who asked for what and where they were sitting. Why not just bring the trolley down the aisle and do a drink service so that everyone has something and it isn't random chaos? Say what you want about the deplorable service on US and Canadian carriers, but at least they do a drink run, even on short flights on small commuter planes. Abu Dhabi is a terrible airport with almost all flights parked remotely and passengers shuttled around in buses.",Passive

Crew mediocre but not rude, food was edible, seats were cramped, maybe a little less leg space than other airlines. There is no IFE in seats, only couple of screens for all the passengers.

"A recent flight from London to New York recently was perhaps the worst experience we've had. We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth.

"  Orlando to Chicago. I was supposed to take a vacation during in early September. Then hurricane Irma was supposed to hit right when I was going to fly in.

Frontier Airlines gave me no problems, but Spirit was ready to charge me their everyday fee to change my flight. I spoke to a supervisor with Spirit and they allowed me to change it for 1 week later. The following week, my resort was still going to be shut down until almost half way through my stay. I sent an email requesting a refund or credit with frontier and they refunded me with no problem. It looked as though I would need to call Spirit and did so explaining that I would not be in Orlando to take part in their flight from Orlando to Chicago because of the after effects of hurricane Irma. They said they could not do anything for me. The gentleman I sopke with informed me they would need to charge me a cancellation fee and that would cost the whole amount of the 2 one way tickets I had purchased.

I was diverted over and over to their lost and found form. I filled it out hoping they'd find it and I'd get it back, but I never heard from them again. I'd expect an email saying ""we're looking"" at least. I never recovered my iPad, which is frustrating, but I don't put that on the airlines. Perhaps the stewardess didn't see it sitting on my seat and another passenger snatched it up. I'm just really disappointed with the customer service.",Detractor
"  Los Angeles to Paris CDG in First Class, connecting to Barcelona in Business class. It lived up to expectations and the service was overall excellent. Arrived at LAX and was escorted through security which took about 3 minutes by a member of the dedicated La Premiere staff. AF uses Qantas first class lounge at LAX which was very nice though totally empty at the time departure- food selection was overall very good with great choice of spirits. I was escorted to the aircraft and onboard the service was excellent. The seat is enormous, 4 windows long with a beautiful screen fabric. There were two staff for 4 pax which mean service was very personal with the crew stating they would take excellent care of you. The food out of LAX was very good (dessert the most delicious tart I have ever tasted!) but entrees could have used a bit more imagination and breakfast was a bit weak. Service was superb and the bed was wonderful (slept 6 hours straight) with Krug champagne. On arrival at CDG was personally met and driven to first class lounge. To say the service was good here would be an understatement. The food was spectacular and on par with a Michelin star restaurant. Was then driven to connecting flight where the crew greeted me by name. Return flight was equally as good with food better out of Paris the foie gras risotto was unbelieveable. I was met on arrival and taken through border control and to my onward flight in terminal 7. Overall this was an outstanding product. Only negative I would say is that the service out of Barcelona was weak and luggage took forever in BCN. Would definitely fly them again.",Promoter

MUC-PEK-HKG-PEK-MUC over June and July 2012. Check-in at MUC handled very professionally by Lufthansa. Assigned a bulkhead seat from MUC-PEK. Legroom is therefore excellent. Cabin crew spoke very poor English and showed little enthusiasm. The food is nothing extraordinary - portions were small and bland. IFE is AVOD with a reasonable section. PEK-HKG operated by a wet-leased Air Macau A320 - no IFE same mechanical service and poor food options. Service on return leg was mediocre. The excellent IFE hardware with touch screens cannot make up for the lack of film and TV options. Food worse than outbound and the white wine almost undrinkable.

" WOW air definitely managed to wow me to the fullest by offering the worst flight experience in my life. I was flying from my vacation in the US from Baltimore to Amsterdam with a stopover in Keflavik airport. We got on the airplane in Baltimore without any problem and never expected what was about to happen. After all passengers were on board the captain announced that they have hard time closing the luggage door of the aircraft. He said that it is not supposed to cause any serious delays. After waiting for one hour on board the captain made another announcement that the door is still stuck and they need to find some equipment with hot water to unfreeze it. In the end, we stayed for 3,5 hours on board waiting for them to fix the luggage door. Upon arrival to Keflavik, we were just told to go to the meeting point to receive further information as all flights to Europe by WOW air left without waiting for any passengers who flew from the US or Canada. We waited for 8 hours for any information to arrive without any support or assistance from WOW air. No food or drinks were served, no communication was done whatsoever. In the end, after 8 hours of waiting, all people who missed their European flights were told to fly to Brussels instead and take a bus to their final destination. When we got on the Brussels airplane, we were told two things. First, we will fly with a stopover in London. Second, we need to leave the airplane because UK is not in Shengen so we need to pass the passport control. In the end, our trip took us 28 hours to get to Amsterdam from Baltimore with a total delay of 18 hours. I would not recommend to fly with WOW air even if they offer you a ticket for free. The only reason to fly with them is if you really want to have this WOW feeling that they guarantee with each flight.",Detractor

  Warsaw to Aberdeen on an A320. When I arrived at the gate I was told the flight was slightly delayed. Boarding was very chaotic.

We had to wait around 40 minutes next to the runway and were not given any explanation from crew about what was happening. We departed with nearly a 1 hour delay. After departure the crew went round with food and duty free. The 7 year old aircraft was very uncomfortable. The seat was hard and parts of it were torn. There was minimal legroom and the tiny tray table was dirty. However you can't expect anything better considering the price for the ticket which was around Â£15.

AM 669 from SFO to Mexico City in Clase Premier / Business Class on January 23 2015. The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing.

I flew business class from Singapore to Delhi two days ago and the service was extremely poor and shoddy. We were flying in from Brisbane by Singapore Airlines and took the flight to Delhi after a stop over at Changi airport. So I was in a position to compare the service on two flights of the same airlines. While on the flight from Brisbane the service was good on the flight to Delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. On a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. Pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad.

"  Dublin to Fuerteventura EI770 on December 27th with my wife. Seats 5a and 5b. We waited until after the food and drink service finished before reclining our seats. The people behind were kicking and pulling the seats for quite a lot of the way. About 40 mins before landing the man behind just pushed my wife's seat forward aggressively several times. We called the cabin crew, and the CSD came down to us. Despite the couple behind being quite drunk, and very aggressive, her way of dealing with the situation was to ask us to put our seats upright. We complied with her request and then had to put up with our seats being kicked and loud comments for the remainder of the flight. This is the worst experience I have ever had on any airline, and it was compounded by the way it was dealt with. At no point did the CSD speak to them and ask them to calm down, nor did she ask them to stop disturbing us. It felt like we were being punished by the airline, and that the most aggressive passengers were being rewarded. If they were that drunk over three hours into the flight then it had to be due to drink sold onboard to them, and this is unacceptable. I appreciate that the CSD did what they felt would easily diffuse the situation, and we complied with her request. However she should have made appropriate requests of the other passengers, and she did not. When we landed and had just left the runway, the drunk guy behind stood up in the aisle and proceeded to get his luggage down, we were on the taxiway, they just left him alone despite this being a safety issue. I received a form response from Aer Lngus, and I thought they would at least give us a complimentary drink on our return flight, but nothing.

Seats were more comfortable than I thought they would be based on previous reviews. Flight Attendants pleasant and made several passes with water for a three hour flight. Return was delayed two hours in JAC. Not a problem for me as I had a 5 hour layover scheduled in ORD. Equipment was an A320 as well and the Flight Attendants were pleasant and attentive. I would give higher marks for seat comfort except both ROC-ORD and ORD-ROC segments were on a regional partner using an ERJ-145.

CDG-Beijing / Shanghai-CDG. First class on the way out business class on the return. Check-in at CDG was smooth and Air China own staff greeted each first class passenger and was escorted to the passport check area.

It was however like a Turkish Airlines long haul business class seat but with more privacy. Male flight attendant was very kind and nice but definitely needs a touch up on grooming while female flight attendants were immaculate in grooming but need a brush up on service skills. Bizarre meal combination with Chinese spicy chicken and prawn served with Risotto. Whole service lacks refinement and sophistication of other airlines but very efficient.

LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. After a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. The crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed FA said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly hot. Arrived at Paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.,Passive
"Manchester to New York via Dublin with Aer Lingus. Left the miserable staff of Manchester airport for the smiley staff of Dublin airport. Strolled through security and immigration without problem. Boarded our flight, greeted by lovely staff who couldn't do enough for us, and this went on for the whole flight. They dealt with a gentleman who took ill as we were taxiing and had to leave the flight with such care and professionalism. The wine choice was very good as was the food for inflight dining. The cabin was clean and fresh with plenty of room and wifi! On arrival at JFK our luggage was there within minutes, and we left the airport without that awful standing in line to clear immigration you normally have. Return flight overnight on Sept 22nd another brilliant experience, thanks to the friendly crew who carried out duties with a focused attitude. We were extremely impressed with the overall experience. Well done Aer Lingus and Dublin airport. As soon as we trade in our BA air miles we will become Aer Lingus customers.",Promoter
SEA-DEN-OKC-DEN-OKC. Overall service was really good. Had a huge delay from DEN-OKC due to crew scheduling issues but other 3 legs were on time. Food selection was adequate for these flight duration's but the aircraft interiors need to be refreshed. With that said seats on 3 of the 4 legs were uncomfortable due to high wear and tear. IFE was not free like Virgin America or JetBlue. It's terrible how the US airlines are charging for everything now it's getting ridiculous.,Passive
I flew Magnifica (Business) Class from Rome to JFK on March 15 2014. The service and the food were excellent - one of the best in the industry. The planes were clean and new. The Alitalia Lounges at FCO however leave much to be desired. I go out of my way to fly Alitalia.,Promoter
First time user of Ryanair so to be on the safe side booked seats and got priority boarding. We were very surprised at how smoothly everything went. Coming back from Palma it was obvious the people in front of us had used Ryanair before. They were a couple with two children and had put a large bag on the floor with coats on top and got the youngest child to lay on it. The father had another large bag over his shoulder. The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase. After we all boarded a young couple squashed into the extra legroom pretending to let people pass by then were amazed that there was no seats left together so they ended up sitting there. We the ignorant passengers had to pay for our extra leg room.,Promoter
I travelled with SK1605 from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Zurich Airport on November 26. The aircraft on this service was a Boeing 737-700W and I travelled in SAS Plus on seat 4A. As always the cabin crew were very helpful polite and service-minded. The comfort of the seats were reasonably good and much better than the Slim Recaro seats found with many of the Star Alliance members on Intra-European routes. Since this aircraft was relatively new the cabin interior was nice and tidy. SAS Plus is marketed as Business Class but the level of service drink food and the general experience is drastically reduced compared to SAS previous Business Class. I was fortunate enough to have a free middle seat next to the other passenger which increased the comfort. The in-flight service is identical to SAS Go (previous Economy) but everything is included in the price when travelling with SAS Plus. The food consist of a choice between cold sandwiches or a salad served in a paper box and the drinks are for free. The quality of the food is acceptable but not what to expect when you travel in a class marketed as Business Class with ticket prices comparable to this class. I still hope that SAS will reintroduce the excellent Business Class the previously offered on Intra-European routes.,Passive
" New York JFK to Port-au-Prince via Miami. I have never had such a terrible experience flying before. Before boarding they informed us that there was no more room in the airplane for our carry-on's and that they would take our luggage as checked baggage and said it was free of charge (of course since I didn't ask for it). Arriving at my destination no carry on! They only knew that my bag didn't make it on the flight, that it would be arriving with another flight they don't know when. I spent 3 weeks in PaP calling everyday going back in forth to the airport which was 45 min away from where I was staying. Terrible customer service, terrible communication. In the end they asked me to file a Customer property Questionnaire in order to get reimbursed for the lost bag. I filed it on the 3rd January, today is the 13th March, I've been calling their service long distance calls every other day to get no relevant information on my request. Well they've lost a client for good.",Detractor
" Flew Air China from Stockholm to Beijing. Cheap tickets, efficient service both on ground and inflight. Ok entertainment system and good comfort for the economy seats. The food was sub-par, not very tasty but edible. We flew with kids and had different bookings upon check in. The check in personell at PEK was very helpful to arrange it so that the whole family could sit together despite a fully booked flight. Overall a good experience especially counting in the price - the tickets were very cheap.",Passive
"I was disappointed with the outgoing 3-hour delay on American Airlines, but stunned with the overnight delay on the return. They offered no apology, vouchers for hotels, meals, a cab, and even said at the airport that we had to call reservations on our cell phones to rearrange connecting flights for the next day. As a teacher with a job I cannot miss, this was extremely inconvenient. No explanations were offered about the delay, except that the plane was arriving late from it's last location. The announcements of delays were very late, right around the 4pm scheduled departure time, well after they were informed of a delay (2:30pm, according to the national reservation office). This left no time to find alternative flights for the same day. I had to spend an hour in the lobby calling the national reservation office multiple times to check on flights from neighboring airports, even Dulles and Reagan International, several hours away, but there was no time (or vouchers for transportation) to get there. Delays overnight are inexcusable by a major airline, particularly when there is no snow or other obvious impeding weather.",Detractor

"Once British Airways review their seating facilities, I will use the airline again. The seats are so cramped and when the passenger in front decided to recline his seat that was it, no matter how much I asked him to recline back, he would not do it.

"  Got a really cheap fare on SAS's route out of Dublin to Bergen with a stopover in Olso for â‚¬60. Very full flight. Flight did leave Dublin an hour late which gave me a tight timeframe to make the connection to Bergen. However, the flight attendants assured me I'd make the connection but if I didn't I'd be booked on the next available service. Oslo airport is presently under reconstruction so it wasn't possible to use the domestic transfer route meaning I had to go through passport control & out through security again but this was swift and hassle-free. The crew were professional, warm, friendly and engaging. No request or question was a bother for them. Coffee/tea/water is provided complimentary and all other items are charged. The menu card is limited but prices are what you'd expect on these European route and quite reasonable. I travelled with carry-on baggage only with a backpack of 9-10kg and there were no issues over dimension restrictions. The Bergen-Oslo flight was aboard a new 737-800. Seats were comfortable and the aircraft was very clean. Crew very efficient for a short 40 minute flight. All in all a very professional airline and pleasant experience. Would not hesistate in using SAS again with fares like this.",Promoter

Recently travelled AC Rouge to/from Cuba. This was a short flight of 3.5 hours. The seats were comfortable but not roomy. My husband and I left the arm rest between us in the upright position so did not feel as restricted. There is no on-board entertainment but I-Pads could be rented for $10.00. We had researched the airline and were aware of the lack of entertainment so we were prepare with our own - book cross stitch music crossword puzzles etc. The food provided (charged to your credit card) was fresh and tasty. The flight attendants were very young and needed a bit more experience in customer service. TIP - book your seat prior to flight and near the front section of the plane sometime run out of food choices by the time they get to the back part of the plane. Would not want to take AC Rouge on a much longer flight. There is not a lot of room between the seats and almost nil when the person in the seat in front of you reclines their seat.,Passive
"  In generally terms, we had good experiences, during the trip Panama to Frankfurt return. We have to congratulate one staff who was the flight customer service most friendly in the world, specially with my mother who needed a wheel chair arriving Frankfurt from London on Saturday 11 of November. He took us as if we were his family (we were 6 people) and guided us wonderfully through this huge Frankfurt Airport to the Hilton Garden Hotel. However at the following morning (Sunday 12, November) despite we asked for similar service (a wheelchair), Lufthansa failed totally. We waited about 45 minutes in the Hotel reception, to received a laconic communication from the airline explaining that was ""system failure"" and did not book the service. On the other hand, Lufthansa services and his workers in the airport are in a bad mood. Returning to Panama was an odyssey trying to get information about the process of check-in. And we had to weigh our luggage and put the tags ourselves? And the boarding gate place B62 is awful it looks like a 19th century factory.",Passive

From what I saw about the LOT ground staff, I am not surprised that 2 of 3 my checked luggages were damaged. They must dropped them from quite a height, which made the 2 wheels on one side broken. LOT has great aircrafts and the staffs on board were excellent in foreign languages, but with such poor quality and responsibility of the ground staff LOT needs more efforts to improve before becoming a competitive airline.",Detractor
"Bangkok to Madrid via Helsinki. We were very pleased with Finnair business class - lie-flat beds, One World member and a more competitive price than several other airlines. The crew were outstanding and friendly, proactive and nothing was too much of a problem. Finnair's business class product is closer to Malaysian than Qantas or Emirates - but was comfortable. We had one of the refitted A330s for BKK-HEL, while HEL-MAD was standard Eurobusiness (regular seats on an A320 with a vacant middle seat). Food BKK-HEL was very tasty, there was a great wine selection. The lie-flat bed could have done with additional padding, but was comfortable enough for six hours sleep. The Finnair Lounge at Helsinki was very busy, but there were seats, snacks and drinks for our two hour wait for our connecting flight to Madrid. Our return flight was in Eurobusiness on an A320 for STO-HEL then a refitted A340 for HEL-SIN. It was a pleasant surprise to get a refitted A340 for our return journey - just as comfortable experience as our first Finnair flight with efficient Singaporean-based crew.

"  London Gatwick to Ford Lauderdale. Having flown domestically to FLL I jumped at the opportunity to fly direct to FLL from the UK. At LGW a premium cabin ticket gives you access to the One Lounge giving a haven away from the main waiting area. There are plenty of drinks and snacks - the food items available to order are limited and perhaps a bit heavy but having lounge access included is a definite plus. I arrived at the gate and there were 3 lines processing passengers. There was no dedicated line for premium cabin holders advertised and I was in no particular hurry to board so I did not test is priority was available by pushing my way to the front of line. I did observe one person being ejected from the flight for failure to supply satisfactory onward travel arrangements before boarding - they are very hot on this so if you are travelling ESTA ensure you can explain to Norwegian what your onward travel plans are if you are not a return ticket! On board I was offered some water before departure. The seat has plenty of legroom (6ft 4in) and the width is good. It is a recline seat but unless you are small you will have difficulty getting into a natural sleeping position. It is vastly superior to other airlines Premium Economy offerings. Better than Premium Economy but not lie flat business. Food is a standard economy single tray meal augmented with bread on the side. In the premium cabin the main meal and a snack before landing with soft drinks decanted from large bottles / cartons (and also some wine from what I saw) are included with your ticket whereas cans and items such as nuts or anything else off the on-demand menu would need to be purchased like in the main cabin. Conceptually the premium product is excellent. However, arriving into FLL internationally is a poor experience and Norwegian have to accept some of the responsibility as it is a core element of their product. The flight was due to arrive at 20.00. We arrived early at 19.00. We went directly to a stand but there was no air bridge available. The airport claimed due to a number of flights arriving at the same time they could have us disembark and so we were left waiting for the handling agents to service the aircraft. 20.00, our scheduled arrival, came round and still we were left on the plane, doors locked. It became clear that the 344 seat 787 was going have to wait for buses and stairs. Finally at 20.30 a full hour and a half after landing facilities were provided. On opening the doors the ground handling agent ""jokingly"" told the cabin crew to inform the flight crew that they should ""not fly so fast"" seemingly insensitive to the fact that so many long haul passengers had been locked on the aircraft for an hour and a half after an 8.5 hour flight. How can Norwegian find this service from their handling agent acceptable? Immigration/Customs at FLL is chaotic. There is no dedicated line for US passport holders or permanent residents so everyone is lumped together. Unless you have Global Entry be prepared. After landing at 7pm I was finally able to leave the airport terminal at 2330. If you fly Norwegian into FLL you need to prepare yourself for the fact the FLL is not really ready to handle such large international aircraft gracefully if there is just the slightest change in capacity. Unfortunately this torrid experience undermines the great price for the ticket (Â£1000 return). The American cabin crew were very pleasant and accommodating of drinks requests",Passive
LAX to DFW in seat 10F return in seat 20D. Booked regular economy but when checking in online offered an upgrade to Main Cabin Select.

" First time with Air Canada. Traveled Boston to Dubai return via Toronto. Had trepidations about booking with them based on existing reviews but wanted to avoid having to pay an additional $800 for a non-stop with another carrier. Outgoing packed a medium size carry-on in case checked luggage does not arrive with me. Turns out this precaution was totally not needed. Air Canada was wonderful. Ground staff were friendly, and importantly, were intelligent and understood passengers' questions. On all 4 flight sectors, service was efficient. On all flights but the last, FAs were cheerful and went about their tasks with a smile. Food was mediocre, but, really, who realistically expects fine dining in economy? Plenty of liquids and juices on board. Legroom was okay. Had an aisle seat for sectors 2 and 3, and middle-guy and window-guy could easily slip by without my having to stand up. All flights on time.

"This is a very mediocre Business Class product and definitely not up to the standards of other airlines. The seats are tight with no storage space for even a bottle of water and the configuration is poor. I had 16K as I was told it is the best seat in the cabin - back corner, rear facing but very private. Forget any meal choice - being at the back means you get what you are given. Wines were ok but the food was ordinary. The crew were probably the best part of the whole experience - but they are nowhere near the standard set by Qantas crew. You can do far better with Qantas, Emirates or Cathay - forget travelling with BA as it's just not worth it.",Detractor

The cabin crew were really nice and professional. For the inflight entertainment they have a great variety of movies, TV shows, music playlists and so on. However, one suggestion was that it would be better to make a facelift on the products as it seems a little bit old. It would also be better to have inflight Wi-Fi service and the camera view on all the A330 fleets.",Promoter
" Delhi to New York via Beijing. My experience with Air China was horrible. I won't recommend it to anyone. They are unprofessional, not ready to listen to anyone. They changed my boarding pass to another flight. My transit time became 11 hours from 1.5 hours because of this. Didn't give me lounge at first. There was no food arranged by them. No internet. They owe a responsibility to arrange lounge, food, hotel if they are the one changing anyone's flight. Ground staff wasn't listening to anyone. Now after boarding to this changed flight, I got to know that my meal preference were not mentioned in crew members chart. And because of their unexpected change I missed my following flight. They didn't compensate even for that. At New York airport when I tried to explain it to their staff, he gave me one email address to file complaint. Guess what, that email address was not for complaints. It was for baggage claim. Now I had to call their office many times to get right email address. Meanwhile I was directed from one place to other.

After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice.

Seats are ok too although for someone tall like me leg room is not as comfortable however I asked the flight attendant if I can be moved to the door exit seats which was empty at that time and she was fine with me doing that.

Gatwick-Tampa. Check in simple lounge at Gatwick average aircraft B777. Clean and departed on time. On board pleasant welcome food just about ok after some research chose seat 4K window you won't disturb anyone getting out. But have to agree with mostly everyone else that seats are small and facing a stranger is quite odd. Cabin crew excellent flight crew informative through out the flight which landed on time. Anyone booking Business as opposed to Eco or Eco plus should know that all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat seat and allowance of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in Eco. Good films to choose from but music naff as is the screen. Brought my own in ear Bose IQ20 headset Excellent for flights.,Passive
"Calgary to Los Angeles via Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada multiple times and normally never had bad service, but this experience consisted of a 26-hour hold up in Vancouver International Airport. While the initial delay was due to factors beyond Air Canada's control, our family was then overbooked on multiple flights, transferred to a United Airlines flight, only to be rejected from boarding that flight due to Air Canada not transferring our bag (United Airlines stated that without our bag, they would not let us board the flight due to liability concerns). We then had multiple conversations with various Air Canada employees, one of whom in particular was aggressive and confrontational, telling me at one point that I should consider myself lucky that she was spending her time dealing with me. She also lied to us on multiple occasions. Air Canada eventually offered us a hotel and a flight via Seattle the next morning, and then did a complete about face after we accepted, refusing to honour the offer they made less than an hour before. The reason our bag was not transferred to United Airlines (as we discovered when we went to collect it after the last flight for the day had left from Vancouver Airport without us on board), was that it had already flown to Los Angeles earlier that day. Ironically, we did eventually end up flying from Vancouver to Seattle, and then taking Alaskan Airlines from Seattle to Los Angeles the next day (as Air Canada had offered us shortly after the United Airlines fiasco). I tried to follow this issue up with Air Canada's customer relations department, but unfortunately they failed on multiple occasions to even recognize my concerns adequately (for example, the reply about my concern with not being allowed to board the United Airlines due to lost baggage was to state that the ""aim [of Star Alliance] was to build an airline alliance which would improve the travel experience of customers."" The reply did not address my concern at all after this statement, leaving me rather confused as to what Air Canada was trying to get at.",Detractor
" Had a late night flight with SAS Scandinavian from Berlin to Stockholm. Boarding and getting on the flight went smoothly.

"â Unverified | Havana to Vancouver via Mexico City. I will say the cabin crew and the flight itself was actually pretty good. My review is regarding the airline's ground crew and counter staff at Benito Juarez International in Mexico City. We were travelling from Havana, Cuba to Vancouver, Canada, transiting through Mexico City. Flyers are unable to do online check-in when flying from Havana. The airline simply does not allow this. So this meant getting to the Havana airport super early for our 6am flight. We were checked in all the way to Vancouver, but were only given the boarding pass to Mexico City. We were told to collect our boarding passes upon landing. The flight from Havana to Mexico City was fine. Landing at Benito Juarez International, upon clearing customs, we were greeted by Aeromexico staff who had pre-printed boarding passes for multiple flights. It was a bit odd because they were standing in the open with literally hundreds of boarding passes piled in front of them, and they were positioned between the exit doors and the bathrooms. They didn't find our boarding passes and we were instructed to go to the kiosks. The boarding passes wouldn't print from the kiosks. We were told this was because we'd already been checked in and the boarding passes had already been issued? So we were then directed to line up for a counter agent. When we reached the counter agent, we were told to go to another line up, for another counter. This counter was specifically for ""issues with kiosks printing boarding passes""! There were three counters and two agents working, but only one agent appeared to be working at any given time, as they would periodically disappear. After reaching this final agent, we were able to get our ""pre-issued"", ""pre-printed"" boarding passes. This process took nearly 90 minutes from the time we entered the terminal. It's the first time I've experienced something like this but judging from the comments, it's not uncommon. The flights themselves were fine. The attendants were efficient and the food was acceptable. The seats were decent, as was the onboard entertainment system. The flight from Mexico City to Vancouver had USB ports to charge devices while inflight. I really appreciated that. The airline was let down by the airport processes and staff. I could see people easily missing their connections if they got caught up in this runaround.",Detractor

AMS-SFO. Was keen to take this flight because of the unusual schedule leaves AMS at 09.50 not uncivilised but with a ten hour flight time and an eight hour time difference it lands in SFO at 11.45. Wake up in Europe and be on the Pacific coast before noon! I tracked the punctuality of the flight in the two days before my own and it was five hours late and four hours late respectively so I should have been relieved that we were taxiing only one hour late although my dream of a morning arrival in California was dashed. The reason given was late arrival of the inbound aircraft but with all the flight tracking apps these days airlines are going to have to be more creative with their excuses - our aircraft had arrived from Paramaribo hours earlier and on schedule. New business class seat on KLM is pretty good note that only window seats have a little shelf next to the headrest so I had room for books iPod et al but not sure what aisle pax are supposed to do with their stuff. Food was excellent was sorry they didn't have a spare as I would have eaten it up despite being quite full. Only downside was the crew were not very friendly overall and one in particular was extremely unhappy to be there a lot of hostility on show which is inappropriate given what biz class pax have paid. Landed half an hour late still one of the first international arrivals of the day so immigration took only a couple of minutes and bags were delivered promptly. I would take this flight again but hope for a happier crew next time.,Passive
"FRA-IAD with Lufthansa. I was upgraded to ""Premium Economy"" due to Senator status and a full plane so they bumped ""upwards"". It was a new 747-800 so the screens were OK and picture quality good. Positives: Better food than regular economy. Better legspace and seat pitch than regular economy. Negatives: Lousy headphones same as regular economy so could not hear the movie properly. Premium economy cabin was ""messy"". Strange sharing with regular economy in 4 rows before Premium and approx 8 rows behind in mid section. So premium was in the middle of regular economy so it did not feel special in any way it was just as flying regular economy but with better legroom. Service level was same as regular economy due to the location of the cabin. I don't think it is worth the extra cost (600 Euro more for round trip FRA-IAD) for so little extra comfort. If LH reaches Thai Airways premium levels then it is worth the extra money.",Passive
" Washington Dulles to Philadelphia. This flight was delayed almost 3 hours because it originated in Orlando and they could not take off due to severe weather. I must mention that the airport staff once we were notified of the delay immediately brought plenty of water and snacks to distribute to all of us that we're waiting and kept everyone informed with PA announcements and the gentleman at the desk was extremely patient answering every single question from all who came up to him. It really looks like United is trying to do the right thing. Once the aircraft arrived the flight lasted under an hour, we quickly boarded the aircraft and no time we had taken off and landed in Philadelphia. Kudos to United for a job well done!",Passive
"First time using Etihad Airways. Unable to check in online for whatever reason, however I noticed the bagdrop at T4 was the same length as the check in line! Boarding quick I booked the front seat 40J on the lower deck, full flight but seat was fine, with no seat in front and lots of room. PTV worked well, great screen and noise cancelling headset. Food and service was okay. Landed about 10 min late which with a short 45 min connection for the connection to DXB (via road) meant missing the bus with no options for 3 hrs. I chose to pay for a taxi myself. Etihad Airways ground staff at AUH are pretty useless and uninterested. Return checked in at the Ethiad Travel Mall in Dubai with connection to AUH via road, bags checked to LHR. Once at AUH quick security I also paid for a lounge which was okay. Again seat 40J. Flight departed on time at 02:30am, a quick snack before lights out, breakfast served about 2 hrs out of Heathrow. The trip was fine as expected. I might try again in business class for the right price but would probably opt for Qatar Airways given the choice.",Passive

I wish I had read the fine print about onboard meals before I booked with Icelandair. I was stunned that on a long international flight passengers had to pay for snacks and meals. Given the high ticket prices I just assumed that meals were included in the cost but all we received for free was water and juice. I made sure to pack my own food on the way back home as I did not relish the thought of paying outrageous sums of money for mediocre dishes. I will not fly Icelandair again at least not on a long haul flight.,Passive
" Johannesburg to Maputo. I like SAA, and they are always punctual. What I take exception to is their business class cabins on the A319 aircraft with 5 across seating, noticeably different to their A320s with only 4 across. SAA should not be selling the middle seat to ensure conformity. As the airline is struggling financially, I would have though it can't afford to alienate premium customers, but henceforth, if a flight is operated with an A319, I'll downgrade to Economy and save a small fortune. Serving lunch at 0930 in the morning is silly. Most passengers wanted tea and coffee and the crew had a trolley full of wine and champagne. Net effect, the crew really struggled to effectively serve hot drinks to a full cabin, they did just about manage, but it's obvious here whoever makes the catering decisions at SAA has done so to make his/her life easier, not the crew or the passengers.",Passive
I have traveled with this airline several times in the past year from Utah to Arkansas and have never encountered any problems. The last trip was SLC to LR. Once onboard the plane proceeded to the runway where there was a 45 minute delay. Had to return to the gate told we had a choice to deplane or stay but all connecting flights would be missed in DEN. We boarded again and went to DEN. Staff were amusing and more than willing to offer any information. We all received our hotel accommodation food vouchers and questions were answered quickly and efficiently. The next day was a piece of cake - I flew on to SLC but had problems with losing my bag but had it delivered to my home by 5am the next morning. One thing I didn't understand was the first flight they gave a free beverage but the one from DEN to SLC they wanted to charge for a soda. I feel like a beverage is a very small request for the price of an airline ticket.,Passive
  Toronto to Dublin. A very respectable transatlantic offering. Decent seats and IFE. Leg room is about average and food service is relatively good.

In general food was good but it could be better. Flight attendants were outstanding especially on both long haul flights they were just some of the best I have ever had. The worst was that I missed my connection at CDG and the customer service agent wanted me to wait for 6 hours when there was an available flight 1.5 hours after our late arrival.

I missed all my plans for the day at home because I was waiting 29 hours for a returning flight, and I now hate United Airlines with a flaming passion.

" London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Very disappointing that Etihad have twice substituted an A380 with a Boeing 777 on a 13+ hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The Boeing is older, noisier with far less space than the Airbus. Etihad heavily promote the A380 on all their media platforms. I have paid on average about Â£3,500 each trip with my decision based equally on the aircraft as well as the airline. What is most disappointing is the lack of engagement from Etihad when I have complained. It appears the concept of customer service is quite an alien one. Oddly on both occasions when Etihad have used 777s instead of the promoted A380s, citing â€œtechnical issuesâ€, the. A380 appears to be far from full as a 777 could not accommodate all passengers.

Food served was not clearly advised that one option was spicy. I liked the food however overheard another passenger who doesn't like spicy food said that she wished she was told that it was spicy. Had some interesting encounters with cabin crew. First, a cabin crew used his index finger to give instructions to me instead of open palm/hand. Another cabin crew, during beverage serving, gave me the remaining orange juice as if i have no choice to make. Although both were minor hiccups. One funny incident had me cheering silently for the cabin crew as one of the adult passenger (father of another young adult passenger) kept on answering from the opposite row on behalf of his son every time a cabin crew would ask his son thus making a bit of a minor noise/disturbance. Cabin crew reminded the adult passenger that his son is old enough to answer simple questions. Fierce, i liked it. That's why im raising my overall experience score to 8 because of that.",Promoter

In December 2014 I took two separate jetBlue flights one from SFO to JFK and then another from JFK to LAX. These flights were fairly long (5 hours) and I found the service to be quite sterile and mediocre. While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight. I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare. I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones.,Passive

Lufthansa still offers complimentary food and drink aboard intra-Europe flights, which is a nice gesture. The food was a sandwich, which was unnecessary for me so I declined, but a free beer was nice to have. Flight attendants were very friendly throughout. The flight was late due to de-icing, but this wasn't Lufthansa's fault.

WAW-JFK return in new 787. Although this is an upgrade over the 767 they used to have on this route I couldn't help but be disappointed in their new B-Class seat. It looks good but is practically speaking a little cheap and flimsy. The tray tables were difficult to operate and the video screen felt like it was a million miles away. The electrical outlet can only be accessed when the seat is in the upright position. Considering that even American Airlines has gone to a mini suite in their new aircraft you think Lot would have done the same. Food and IFO were both sub par. On the plus side the seats are fully flat. I slept 4 hours very soundly. FA's were also very friendly and helpful. They were definitely the best part of the whole flight.

" Berlin to Abu Dhabi via Amman. I was a bit reluctant flying RJ after reading a lot of negative reviews, but I gave it a try since I am a One World Platinum member and RJ is a member of the alliance. There was no separate boarding line for business or Premium Alliance card holders, it was basically free for all for all 4 flights and it was chaotic. What I found most annoying about the flight was the catering. They served nothing but sandwiches on those 4 flights between 3 and 4.5h. The worst was the Abu Dhabi to Amman sector. A stale piece of bread and a muffin, that's it. Second problem were the FAâ€˜s. Some were not interested in working, particularly on the AUH-AMM flight, which had just 36 pax. One attendant went straight to sleep after the mediocre service after take off. He occupied an entire row and had even eyeshades on. The planes were rather shabby, with broken screens, non functioning seats and not very clean toilets. And did I forget that my points were not credited and I am chasing after them now.

"Zurich to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. When I checked in at Zurich airport, I was not given my 2nd boarding pass i.e. from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi. On asking I was told you are on priority and will be given the boarding pass at Abu Dhabi airport. This was a bit strange but I left it. On reaching Abu Dhabi airport, I approached the Transfer Desk at the arrivals terminal. I had wait for 15-20 minutes before my turn came. This was as bad as checking in all over again. But had no choice. When I finally reached the counter and presented my papers, I was told that the flight was full and there are no seats. I was surprised. I had a confirmed seat in my hand but no seat. My flight was scheduled to leave Abu Dhabi at 10:00 pm and it was around 7:45 pm. The counter guy made a call and after a long time told me that he can put me on a flight next day after noon at 2:00 pm which was 16 hours after my scheduled flight. When I told him that was too late, he made me wait for more time and finally offered to put me on a flight to Mumbai and then from there to New Delhi - so I would again reach New Delhi late afternoon the next day. This was appalling. In the meantime I realised that all the counters at the transfer desk had the same problem. Etihad had overbooked all flights and passengers were being harassed. People were going to Egypt or Australia or Hyderabad. There were other flights during the night and early morning from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi but Etihad had overbooked all and I could not get a seat on any flight. Finally the counter guy told me that they could not help me and I should go to transfer desk on terminal 1. By this time the airport security area through which I had to pass to go to Terminal 1 had become extremely crowded. There was no air conditioning. No queue and total chaos. With great difficulty, I managed to pass through that and reached the Transfer Desk. The guy at the counter quickly offered me a seat on a 2:55 am flight, a meal voucher and 200$ compensation. I quickly accepted the deal. But now the set in the surprise: 200$ voucher could be used only on Etihad Airways travel. Not much use if I did not spend another 1000$ first to book an Etihad airways ticket. After handing over the above voucher the guy came up with the bomber that there are no seats on the 2:55 am flight and he can only put me on the 2:50 pm flight. This was crazy. Since then I have tried my level best, spoke to the supervisor and Etihad personnel on phone. Everyone promised the best but did not deliver anything. And here I am sitting in the lounge. They haven't even provided me with a hotel voucher so that at least I can get some much needed rest. If this is called first class service than what can be more pathetic is anybody's guess. Anybody planning to travel Etihad - please think twice. It's highly possible that you will get stranded like me.",Detractor

Secondly, they routinely check all rollerboards for zone 3 passengers no matter that there are always plenty of overhead spaces. They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to. In summary, hate that airlines take advantage of customers. Unfortunately, Delta isn't the only one that does this.",Detractor
" Los Angeles to Paris CDG. After being a loyal AF customer for all flights to Europe, this trip is the last straw. I keep hoping they will turn things around but things are only going downhill. First, my biggest complaint has always been cleanliness. Most of the times, I fly business and even in business the seat areas are filthy. I always bring wipes to do it myself. No matter how many times I've left this feedback, nothing changes. On an international flight, cleaning down the seating areas is not too much to ask. Besides this, I got to experience premium economy recently due to no availability in business at all. It was underwhelming to say the least. Seats were uncomfortable, service was minimal, and in general nothing validated the up charge from economy. The biggest reason I will no longer fly AF is the lack of customer care from phone support to airport I experienced recently. What is going on with them recently? Anytime you need phone support the answer ranges from ""nothing we can do"" to ""you'll have to ask at the airport."" At the airport, at CDG, presumably their home base where services should be stellar, lines of 20+ were building up due to lack of personnel at all check-in points. Literally 1, maybe 2 in some lines, check in agent for all lines regardless of status or priority. What's more? They have people waiting with absolutely no distinction between checking in for foreigners vs EU residents and yet we get to the front after 30+ minutes in line and tell us we need to be in another line. Which looks like it's going to be at least 1 hour with one agent at the desk with 20+ people in line and building! Ask for help. They just ignore you by saying not their problem with a shrug of their shoulder. Seriously AF and it's workers with their haughty attitudes needs to realize with no customers, there's no airline, and subsequently no jobs. Whatever the internal issues and gripes are between the company and it's workers, paying customers should not have to feel like beggars asking for service that we paid for.",Detractor
"Flew Delta from Detroit to Munich. Overall a good flight, the 767 has seen better days and its age shows with the AVOD system being very slow. Selection of movies was good and kept me reasonable entertained. The flight departed on time and arrived early, staff were friendly throughout the flight and came around often with drinks. The food served tasted good, the small snack that served as breakfast was ok but since they ran out of water they couldn't serve any coffee. Seat lacked padding and at the end of the flight my back paid the price.",Passive
"  Flew Las Vegas to Miami. American Airlines is usually one of my last airlines of choice. But in this case, price and schedule left me no choice, so AA it was. While they continue to try to find ways to cram more people on their planes, and seating is definitely tight, in this case, since it was a red eye, I fortunately managed to sleep through the flight despite being not very comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived a little early and I mostly slept through it, so I guess that's a win! The A321 had inflight entertainment provided via ones own device and wifi. I did not attempt to use it. One thing about AA and MIA is there is a very long walk from the terminal to where the baggage claim is and it took maybe 15 more minutes after this walk before luggage arrived. In this case, the price of the flight was good, I got to my destination safely on time, and I slept through the flight. However, I still do not like American and only chose them when I do not have another choice as they are the dominant carrier out of Miami.",Passive
"Beware of Pegasus Airlines: On 26.2.15 I purchased 2 flight tickets through Pegasus internet site. The confirmed e-Tickets were sent to my email address on the same day. Two days before departure, when trying to make advanced check in, I was surprised to see, at Pegasus site, that the tickets were cancelled without reason. My Visa account showed that Pegasus never charged me, but they did not issue any cancellation note. I bought tickets from another airline, which were, due to time pressure, more expensive. Pegasus customer service claimed that the tickets were cancelled by them as a result of a ""Suspicious Card"" message received from Visa. My Visa service confirmed, in a formal document, that they did not cancel the transaction. Pegasus told me that they have tried to notify me by phone (once) but I was not available. The customer service could not explain why a ticked issued and sent by email is cancelled by a phone conversation, that actually did not happen. By July 2015 I filed a complaint through Pegasus site, but no actual response. I repeated the process by end August 2015. Again no answer and I am still waiting for them.",Detractor

"Return flight Brussels to Kinshasa in business class. Seat arrangement is 1-2-1, then 2-1-2, and so on. All seats have direct aisle access except for the window seats paired to an aisle seat. Cabin crew very good, and catering is probably the best part with a good choice of sdishes, nice wines, and plenty of tasty Belgian beers to choose from. The aircraft was clean when boarding, so were the lavs through the flight. The seat, although converting into a flat bed, is not really comfortable, and can only be moved as whole between different positions (take-off/lounge/sleep), so not possible to move the back or the footrest independently from other parts. Okay for flights up to 7-8h, but not longer.

"Disappointed would be an understatement. When I booked this travel, well in advance, it was under impressions I got from reputable reviewers online. I also considered that a breakup of travel to get to my destination would help with some of the discomfort that comes with long haul flights. Overall, my trip was roundtrip from the US to England, via Keflavik. The usage of Air France's lounge at KIAD was very acceptable and they offered a decent selection of food and drink. The flight to KEF was decent, but nothing mind blowing. The selection of entertainment, once mentioned as the best of any airline, must have come from an Icelandic native, because about half of the entertainment offered was from the native country. The rest of the entertainment was recycled TV shows and movies from the US which was not very appealing. WiFi connections, or lack thereof, was an end result to my disappointment. Seeing as though I was seated in Saga Class, I could connect for free, but this was not possible at all. I had issues with it and even after mentioning it to a flight attendant, they really didn't seem to care. The meal service was decent as well. I was prepared for delicacies that hailed from Iceland, but a few things were hard to swallow. There was a general lack of care by the flight crew on all four flights, which again was a bit disheartening, considering where I sat. Overall, I regretted paying for Saga Class when I barely got the benefits. A layover in BIKF required that I pass through Passport Control, who puts an airline lounge outside of the gate area? Most airports I have been to, have the lounges at the gates, avoiding the needless security check. I had to skip out on that benefit due to a strike going on at Passport Control which would have eventually led to me missing my flights. Yeah, I am going to have to rethink my airline of choice next year. Icelandair left a bad first impression that I am not so easily forgiving to try to them again.",Passive

Barcelona to Rome then connecting from Rome to Miami. We had reservations for the Classica Plus class seats on the Rome-Miami leg. In Barcelona they attempted to print our boarding passes for the second leg of the flight but were unable to after having us wait for over an hour while they attempted to do so. Apparently the original plane was switched to an aircraft without the Classica Plus section. Never informed of this change and apparently neither was the check-in desk in Spain. In Barcelona we were told to report directly to the gate in Rome where they would have our boarding passes. After racing through the airport in Rome and arriving at the gate we were told there was no Classica Plus on this aircraft. Rather than upgrade us to business class we were downgraded to economy class with four seats in the centre of the plane. We were told to go to the ticketing desk in Miami when we landed for a refund of the overcharge. In addition to the downgrade to economy class my reservation for a gluten-free meal was lost leaving me unable to eat most of the food available on the flight. When we finally landed two of our bags were missing. We were then told they were left in Rome. They were delivered late the next evening. We had to then wait at the ticketing desk for our refund. We are still awaiting a refund for the overcharge for economy class.,Detractor
YYC-FRA and back on the two-class 9-abreast 777-300ER. The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint.

NCL-DXB DXB-BKK-HKG then return on the same flights. Outbound Newcastle to Dubai on 777-300ER. Very good flight - good food good choice ICE entertainment system. Dubai to Hong Kong via Bangkok on A380. Again very good flight - spacious seats and same ICE system as on previous flight. Food reasonably good on this leg of the journey but not as good as first flight. The choice I wanted was unavailable on BKK to HKG leg but the option I was served was nice enough. Return Hong Kong to Dubai via Bangkok A380. Same comments apply about A380 as before. Another good flight except food on this flight. Food on both HKG - BKK and BKK - DXB legs were poor and a massive contrast to the other 3 flights. I experienced the same on a previous Emirates Hong to Dubai flight so this looks a like a localised Hong Kong supplier issue. Dubai to Newcastle on 777-300ER - same as outbound - very good flight and very good food. Both 777-300ER and A380 used same ICE so same inflight entertainment across all flights - loads to choose from and good variety. Touch screen sometimes a little unresponsive on return flights. Cabin crew were generally good and helpful with queries but slow with food service sometimes. Outbound Newcastle departure was delayed due to late incoming flight but other flights were on time or within reason. Transfer in Dubai was easy and hassle free - around 2.5 to 3 hours each time.

" Newark to Athens on Boeing 777-300 in Business Class. Emirates is a better airline than any US carrier but it aspires, it says, to be the best airline in the world. It is far from that.My flight was delayed due to some issue of getting our aircraft to the gate. The information about this delay was non-existent at check-in. I found out about the delay only after the agent in the SAS Lounge (who doesn't work for Emirates) told me about it. Eventually, we were told the flight was boarding. We left to discover nothing of the sort. The gate area was chaos. The flight was not boarding, not even close. The employees, about 6 in number, were glued to their smart phones texting and surfing. I would fire every last one of them. They made infrequent and irregular announcements, with incorrect information. The boarding time kept getting moved. The employees sat on their phones. Finally, we started to board. Well, not the Premium passengers. First, the people traveling needing extra assistance and with children. Eventually, Business class boarded, but only after an Emirates person line jumped with a group of passengers in front of us. Once on board, I encountered a seat with a non-functional small video screen that is used to control the seat! Fortunately, the seat next to me was empty. The seat is not the standard these days. Angled lie flat is so 1980. Middle seats in Business Class? Are you kidding, Emirates? Whoever made this decision should be fired. The wine list contained one champagne (good selection) and two whites (one a dismal CA Chardonnay, the other a nice Sancerre) and two reds (one a pedestrian Oregon Pinot and one a 2007 Bordeaux that was quite nice). This selection pales in comparison to Qatar. Food quality was very good, although the crew wanted to rush me through the meal. I didn't let them. Eventually, they adjusted. Crew service was spotty. At times personal and nice, and at times missing or impersonal. The inflight entertainment is extensive but the system is CLUNKY to use and the endless ads before any movie is irritating beyond belief. It is also very hard to scroll quickly through the movie options. They are also poorly organized into categories, in my opinion. For the money, Qatar is a far better airline with a truly premium treatment for people in premium classes. Better seats, friendlier crews, better wine, and an overall better experience is available on Qatar. Emirates has a lot of work to do.",Passive

I had to travel from Singapore to Melbourne with not enough leg room. On top of it the cabin crew didn't bother to provide any food for the baby. They didn't offer me an infant seat belt (I had to insist on one). Singapore airlines is not cheap and we pay the extra money for a comfortable travel. I have been flying Singapore airlines for the past 10 years and this has been the worst travel ever.,Detractor
LGW to Split with 2 adults and 2 kids under 2 which could be a nightmare but Easyjet staff made it a pleasure. We initially had a third adult in our row of three but we were swiftly moved to a row with a spare seat before take off. The crew were terrific with helping us out with milk for our 2 year old and even invited him into the cockpit after landing! It was a thrill for our little guy and a rare treat these days. Great value and outstanding service.,Promoter
" We flew Air China from Warsaw to Ho Chi Minh City and back via Beijing. Cabin staff was nice and helpful, there were no delays or issues with our baggage. The food was quite good (I would say it was better flying to Ho Chi Minh City then back to Warsaw), flight entertainment were also good (30-40 movies in English and new releases like Black Panter and other older movies). The planes were quite old and I believe Air China should update their airplane fleet. We booked lounge in Beijing and as we have 15 hours layovers, it was nice to come to lounge, have some snacks, drinks, use showers and rest a little (we spend most of layover time visiting Great Wall of China and Forbidden City). But over all we were pleasantly surprised with the service, staff, food and flights.",Passive
"  Auckland to Manchester via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific in Premium Economy. On the first flight they ran out of both meals and the staff didn't appear to care. The second meal was served only 3 hours after the first and on a 10.5 hour journey this was not good. I was given an economy meal for both meals - not complaining about the quality of them just the uncaring attitude of the staff. The second leg of my journey from Hong Kong to Manchester was equally bad. Although I got the meals I requested (sitting at the front this time so served first ) the service was just as bad. Not offered any coffee after dinner and just a plastic cup one third full of wine and no refill. Staff indifferent again. I sent detailed comments as a complaint via Cathay website and got no reply, so a week later sent another one and requested at least an acknowledgement - still nothing! Bad customer service is obviously not just confined to the cabin crew. Can't say I'm looking forward to my return journey. I do this journey at least once a year but this was my first time with Cathay Pacific but it will be my last.",Detractor
A mixed bag describes my recent experience on flights between Bangkok/Cairo and Cairo/JFK. As another writer recently bemoaned the aircraft used on the Bangkok/Cairo sector was truly ancient. I do not honestly recall having riden an airliner that looked as worn as that used on this route. I too rode in Business Class yet felt like a sardine in coach class given the paltry amount of leg room available. A complete disaster was averted by fairly decent (but not great) meals and a hard working flight crew. The trip from Cairo/JFK was a totally different story. This time we were on a new 777 with lie flat seats. We had a very caring crew that kept on feeding us meal after meal. Both flights were relatively on time and both captains kept passengers reasonably informed.,Passive
Travelled 3 times SYD-ICN FRA-ICN and ICN-BNE. All 3 flights lots of leg room. SYD-ICN the crew were fantastic continuously bringing soft drinks/water around. FRA-ICN on an old 744 sitting near the back and it was very noisy. Crew allowed many passengers to have carryon baggage on the seats next to them as we came into land. ICN- BNE similar to previous flight but a bit stricter with bags on seats. Flew out in May and back in June but very little had changed on the in-flight entertainment.,Passive
Flew AKL-HKG-LHR. We received priority boarding as a premium economy passenger which gave us time to settle in to our seat. The seat pitch is 38 inches which is the same as BA and Virgin with plenty of room. There were headrests and footrests which made the trip comfortable as well as an amenity kit. The food was amazing probably because it came straight out of business class. Overall the trip was better value for money than Air New Zealand Spaceseat although the entertainment wasn't up to date. I would recommend them.,Promoter
" I recently retired and began my 5 year voyage around the world by starting off on flight 895 from San Diego to Honolulu. However, my travels are, and will be very complicated, because my small companion dog will be accompanying me. Three locations on my trip have strict quarantine requirements beginning with Hawaii. Alaska Airlines is currently the only airline that accommodates a ""pet in cabin"" to the 50th state from the mainland. (The other airlines serving Hawaii, including Alaska Airlines, allow ""certified"" support animals - for which there were two on my flight. While my beloved dog is like a child to me, I could not in all honesty, use this option.) From the initial reservations call to book my pet in cabin reservation, to the arrival in Honolulu, Alaska Airlines has been wonderful, making my trip as easy as possible. Airport personnel in San Diego and Honolulu, as well as the inflight crew, have my utmost appreciation for their professionalism, caring attitudes, and quality of services. Until this recent trip, it's been quite a while since flew with Alaska Airlines as my past recent travels were nearly all transcontinental. But they will definitely have my future business whenever I need to fly on a route that they serve. Thank you Alaska Airlines",Promoter

Flew LHR to MNL - to give some context I've done pretty much every route to Manila in recent years usually based on price at the time. I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.,Promoter

On both flights, service not too good. Although we reserved a bassinet in advance, we still had to request it inflight. Irritating policy on serving food. Travelling alone so I requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. Suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous. Other airlines like SQ are more flexible on such requests. No food served for babies even if you ask. Lastly, difficult to get help when asking assistance with my baby's milk. I had to carry my baby and go all the way to the pantry to get someone to assist me.",Passive

" Denver to Norfolk. My family of 5 travelled with Frontier returning from CO to VA. We checked 7 bags, paying a total of $500 in baggage fees. The flight was not bad although we paid extra for seating also, to only have seats that did not recline. Our trip back home became a disaster upon arrival in VA. We received on 5 of 7 checked bags. We were told bags agents usually lost, we should have it within a day. Whatever. They lost our 6 month old daughters car seat! We were told at least 5 times the â€œloanerâ€ car seat must be returned when we get our original. The car seat was not up to my standards to have my child riding around in. It was flimsy and awfully cheap. I was so disappointed. Luckily one of our rides home from the airport had an additional car seat in their vehicle. We filed the claim and went home. Roughly 2 days later the car seat appeared at our front door with a tag from Fed Ex. No communication just at the front door. I am grateful to have her car seat back but communication would have been great. Nonetheless we still had a suitcase missing. After 4 weeks going back and forward with Central Baggage in CO via phone and email, I was told my case was being escalated. They asked for a lost baggage claim to be filled out and to add receipts for what was in the bag. I sent in receipts for more than $3800. The email stating it was received stated compensation can take up to 6 weeks. I received an email 3 days later stating they would compensate my family $840, everything received was used on a depreciated scale, have a nice life. How dare they tell me my personal belongings for my family is nothing but a quarter to the value after they lost it!

These old planes have small ceiling mounted screens for the whole cabin and our headphones didn't work which on a long haul flight is a big deal. There was a lack of communication between the BA check-in staff on duty for our flight in terminal 5 at Heathrow who assured me that on my fare I would not need to pay extra for a second suitcase in either directions and that of Lima Iberia staff on departure who insisted that I did.The whole experience left me feeling that Iberia has not progressed at all since I last flew with them and that their association with British Airways has done nothing to improve standards.,Detractor

May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane.

" Victoria to Milan via Toronto. My flight left really late from Victoria and as a result my bags did not arrive with me in Milan. I was only there for 7 days, and staying at a villa in a really small town on Lake Como. Three of the people on vacation with me did not receive their luggage. The person handling the delivery was rude and would not speak English. One of us had to wait at the villa every day until all the bags arrived, because there was no reception and no one to receive the bags. Our bags arrived on the 3rd, fourth and fifth day of our stay. I have entered a claim, but have not even received a confirmation that the claim was received. On my return, the flight was again delayed in Toronto for over an hour.

The bags were not taken off and by the time I reached the hotel is was already 12:40 pm When I reached the hotel, I was told that it had been overbooked and that there was no room for me. I had to return to the airport where there was only one poor attendant dealing with all the many issues with Air Canada. Two of us had nowhere to stay. The airline only pays $150 for a hotel room, and there are none at that price near the airport, and they were all full. He finally found us a hotel, but we had to pay for it ourselves and were told to claim the $150 from the airline. My flight the next day left early so I only slept for 4 hours.

"  Phuket to Brussels via Bangkok with Thai Airways. First leg service was just excellent as on the way out from Europe aside from typical delays of coming into a congested airport like Bangkok. The Thai crew in stormy conditions managed to service everyone multiple times on a fully loaded flight, I was dreading the late night double leg flights home but my sensitive sleeping wife cat napped on the short leg and then due to a departing ahead of time settled down after a well served meal for the long haul home. She slept near 10 hours on what was bump free journey landing back ahead of time into Zaventem something never achieved with Brussels Airlines, United Airlines or British Airways night flights. This was my first Thai Airways experience but after flying with big American and European carriers this was something special with their 777-300ER out and back and with one leg of four flights on the one month old A350. It is clear this is an airline in transition with a new fleet coming in and our luck being we that we had all our flights on planes of just a couple of years old. I am now seriously tempted to fly Thai Airways to New Zealand on the next long haul as inflight entertainment and service was very good. This said three things Thai could simply fix to move in my book from Very Good to Excellent. Bringing a fully loaded 777 into a hard standing and using buses instead on to the terminal should not happen, we were lucky at end of rainy season but I dread to think what could have been if the tropical sky's had opened up. If you fly into Francophone countries you should have either copies of the film with French sound track or at least French subtitles, my Wife being French speaking Belgian was lucky to know English well. Your mild chicken is not mild, it was hotter than dishes served up in restaurants of the same this meal blew both us away and could not be consumed on one flight.

I flew from Auckland to LAX recently in business class. From the time I sat down it took 55 minutes to be served a drink while it took my wife an hour and ten minutes to receive her first beverage. The service during the flight was adequate but possible I expected more considering the price of the ticket. I would not recommend Air New Zealand but I would also not discourage one from flying this airline.,Passive
Ryanair is fine to fly most of the time to get from A to B and if you can go hand luggage only. But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.,Passive
"  Fortunate enough to get a real good deal for a Business Class ticket on the inaugural Wellington to Canberra flight on 21 Sept 2016. Check in was quick and efficient, boarding was even quicker. Short Haul Business Class cabin in a 2-2-2 configuration, very comfortable and I found it quite spacious. Cabin crew very friendly as you expect from Singapore Airlines. A little pomp and ceremony being the first every B777-200 commercial flight out of Wellington, the first flight between Wellington and Canberra. Flight was fairly full, only a few seats left here and there. Quick take off and the service began with bubbles of course, food was really tasty and restaurant quality. Cabin crew very attentive, engaging and we had a few laughs along the way too. Flight was smooth, lie flat bed was flat and comfortable, still managed a few zzz's before landing. Seat comfort itself was great and inflight entertainment system, well I didn't try it at all, we were too busy having bubbles and food and laughs. Was a great flight and Singapore Airlines exceeded my expectations on this trip by far!",Promoter

Cabin crew made an announcement to other Co passengers, if any Dr available to take care of him and luckily Dr was available & he checked everything & made me more comfortable.

GRU (Sao Paulo) - FRA (Frankfurt). Impressed with the new Boeing 747-8. Would expect it to be less noisy though. Not a single seat free all three classes were packed. I have to say that the new seat Lufthansa has chosen for this 748 is quite ok far better than the A340-600 one's. Cabin crew ok but a couple of members were everything but polite. Usual long-haul dinner choice (pasta or chicken) usual breakfast. Arrived in FRA 25 minutes before schedule. I keep saying Lufthansa and SWISS beat whatever European airline.,Promoter
"Kansas City to Denver. Decided to visit my girlfriend for New Years and got to the airport at 4:30am on Dec 30th to check in (departure at 6). At 4:35, we are told that the flight was canceled. The pilot was sick - I don't care if you got a sick pilot, you need to be responsible and find someone else or compensate us for the trouble and canceled plans. I was fortunate enough to quickly rebook online with my phone and was on standby for the next flight. I can't say the same for the other 100 people, which had to wait until after New Years to get a flight out. As I waited for the next flight on standby in hopes of a seat, I find that they have overbooked the flight by 17 people.

" Malta to Male via Dubai. Complaint related to irresponsible staff and left without food for the flight from Malta to Male. I suffer from severe celiac condition and I am intolerant for any type of wheat and contamination. My father who booked the flights did not know that he had to book Gluten free meals 48 hours in advance, when we arrived at the airport in Malta, we asked at the check-in counter about gluten free meals and they informed us that the only way to get gluten free meals on board was to reserve the meals 48 hours in advance. We discussed with the inflight staff and asked them if they can spare some meat from the business class meals and the flight attended said that that was not possible. When we landed in Cyprus we asked to talk to the flight purser and she said she will see what she can do, Once we left Larnaka-Cyprus to Dubai, we asked if the crew managed to solve the issue, but they said unfortunately not and there was nothing they can do, they said that they informed Dubai so they can prepare food for the next flight, again I was left hungry on the flight between Larnaka-Cyprus and Dubai. My Father offered to pay extra for the business class food, but the staff said no. When we landed in Dubai, the first thing we done was to go to customer help and information desk and asked if the crew have ordered any Gluten free food for the next flight from Dubai to Male, the desk assistant said that there was nothing on the system and she will try and get some gluten free food on-board the next flight but she said she cannot promise. We boarded the flight from Dubai to Male to Maldives and when dinner time arrived they informed us that there was no Gluten free meals and that there was only 3 meals available for other guests which they pre-ordered.",Detractor
"I've had bad experiences with all airlines with delays and what not but my trip from LAX to Gatwick and back on the Dreamliner went without a hitch. We didn't have a chance to book much in advance but while most airlines were quoting $2000 Norwegian was quoting $1500 and that's the reason we picked them. My trip out was in economy and the leg room for a 6'1"" guy is not the best. I felt really cramped but other airlines are probably doing the same thing. We prepaid for the food/baggage/seat assignment (included in the $1500) and I recommend anyone do that but don't expect the food to be all that great. The chicken tasted boiled. On the way back I opted for premium economy. It was about $300 more which is not bad compared to other airlines but the only real pluses are increased leg room and a 2 suitcase allowance rather than 1 and slightly better food. The beef I had was not bad at all! You get a free glass of so-so wine with the meal and a Bailey's to cap it off (premium economy only) but I found it weird that I still had to cough up $7 for a beer later in the flight! Really? The movie choice was limited - I didn't know most of the titles but I guess there was enough choice to keep me amused. The electrochromic windows are weird. There's a button under each window to let you darken/lighten it but the crew take over the controls for most of the flight so you don't actually get to adjust it to your liking. Bring back the shades!",Promoter
"Flew from London to Bangkok and return with Thai Airways. The economy service is on par with other four star airlines - the real difference is the actual aircraft you are on and how new it is. The A380 was really good, the 777 was older and not so good but still plenty of space and a decent TV - shame about the content. Maybe I was unlucky with timing but it was hard to find a good film, there are lots of cheap films and not much premium content.

" Frankfurt to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. Extremely disappointed with the poor service and below average standards on our flights. We visit family in Germany every year and having flown other airlines (business class) we took our agents recommendation and flew Etihad Airways for the first time and most definitely the last time. I am taking the time to write this review just on 24 hours from getting home because my husband, daughter felt that we were (and other passengers) inconveniencing the crew. Their negative attitude and lack of professionalism were not acceptable. On a positive note checking in at Frankfurt Airport was excellent, easy and staff were friendly. However, from the moment we entered the aircraft we noticed the cabin crew rushing around, looking very stressed and un politely pushing passengers aside saying, â€œplease moveâ€ to get past. At no time were we properly greeted or welcomed on board. The aircraft on our first leg of the journey was old and a bit shabby and the seats were not really comfortable. When we ordered our meal (I requested the lamb dish) I was told they had run out! After dinner was served the staff disappeared and were pretty much non-existent. Fortunately, it was only a 6.5 hr flight. However, the second leg of our flight 12.5 hrs was dreadful. Larger aircraft and seat/bed comfortable, our biggest disappointment again was the cabin crew. Except for one crew member who was somewhat polite the rest of the crew were unprofessional and just not visible during the flight. I requested a meal at about the 6-hr point of the journey and had to wait an hour â€“ the food however (Grouper) was really good! My biggest shock came 1.5 hrs before landing in Melbourne when I woke up and requested a cup of coffee and some breakfast (they did not come to me I had to go to the galley). I was told by the female attendant that the ovens were turned off and they had no hot meals left. I explained that I had several hours in Melbourne to connect to Sydney and asked if I could maybe have a coffee and some toast to which the female crew member said, â€œyou could get some breakfast and a better coffee in Melbourneâ€. I could give you more details about our whole journey but want to limit by saying I will not recommend Etihad to family and friends and certainly not fly Etihad again. I know that it is not Etihad's fault but Abu Dhabi Airport was also a nightmare - understandably a larger airport than Sydney but even though we were in transit everyone had to go through security checks (applaud this) but was chaotic and over crowed and understaffed. Scary airport! In a few words, very poor service and below average standards â€“ we will stick to Singapore Airlines, Thai and Lufthansa no matter what the price difference is!",Detractor

"I have never been particularly impressed by any US airline but this Delta Air Lines trip to fly Seattle to Moscow via Paris takes the cake in terms of incompetence and lack of accountability. The flight was SEA-CDG-SVO and was initially meant to depart at 1:00pm. First delay was 4 hours for mechanical issues. This meant a rebooking of my connecting flight, no problem. Around 5:00pm, still no plane in sight. Around 6pm, announcement that plane was here and being prepped but needed to be fueled for the trip and the crew is about to be timed out so once the plane is ready, you better be ready to board. No problem. After more than 5 hours and only a couple of slices of cold pizza as compensation, we were ready to get out of there. Once boarded another announcement, some passengers did not board (they were the smart ones), so their bags have to be removed. One hour later, another announcement, as anticipated, crew is about to time out, solution is that we fly to MKE and change crew there (assured that there will be fresh crew in MKE - right). But then there is too much fuel on the plane, as it was meant to be a transatlantic flight. So have to remove some fuel in order to fly to MKE. An hour later, why have we not moved and why has air conditioning on the plane been turned off? They can't figure out how to remove the excess fuel and turned off air conditioning to facilitate the removal but forgot to turn it back on! So around 9:00pm, rumors start circulating amongst the crew and those standing at the open door and gangway that the flight might be cancelled. At this point, that almost sounds like a blessing. By the time the announcement is made at 9:30pm that the flight is being cancelled, many of those in the know have already left the plane. So a mad rush to get off the plane and get rebooked and situated for the night. At time of rebooking they assure us that the same flight will be OK to go the next day at noon. Put you up at a hotel and here is a $15 meal voucher. Since its 10:00pm already, not a lot open at the airport to get a meal at. But weary and blurry-eyed, we are thankful for anything. Next day, refreshed for a night's sleep and hopeful to finally get out of SEA, arrive at the airport again, go through the same drill, get through security, great, flight is still on time, go get coffee and walk to gate. Fellow passenger stops me mid-way to gate and tells me don't bother, the flight has been cancelled again! Go to customer service and try to get rebooked. Get to customer service and line is a mile long and not moving. Opt to jump on the phone and try to get a flight. Lady on the phone rebooks me on a flight SEA-MSP-AMS-SVO. That's one more leg than I'd like but heck, get me out of SEA! It is now 11:26am, the flight to MSP is scheduled to depart at 11:30am from a gate that I have to take an airport train to get to. Booking agent assures me that the departure time is actually 11:50am so I have time. Finally get rebooked, rush to gate. Get there at 11:32am. Gate has closed! Gate agent firmly states that flight was scheduled for 11:30, I am late and doors are closed. At this point, I am near tears. How do I get out of this airport?? My one piece of luck, the gate agent actually relents and reopens gate to let me on.",Detractor

Just returned from another business trip from Vienna to Bucharest and back. My flight was paid for by the company I work for and I flew Economy class and it was the exact same story as before - unfriendly cabin crew horrible in-flight catering and relatively uncomfortable (hard) seats. Both my flights were operated by an A320 aircraft which to my surprise was relatively clean. However my first flight from Vienna to Bucharest OS 783 got cancelled apparently due to low demand. I was re-routed to Bucharest on the next day on OS 791 which was alright although I missed an event I was supposed to attend in Bucharest. The flight back was uneventful and was about 35% full (I even had one entire row to myself. On this leg there was an on-time takeoff and landing back in Vienna. The food consisted of a choice between an Apple or a small bag of solettis. I heard some flight attendants refuse to give passengers either two soletti bags or two apples - Each passenger is only allowed one which is simply unacceptable. There is however a decent variety of drinks as well as decent in-flight entertainment. I honestly could not feel more sorry for myself having to fly Austrian for each one of my business trips. If it'd be my choice I'd choose Tarom for the VIE-OTP route without hesitation or simply any other airline other than Austrian.,Detractor

" New York to Johannesburg. South African Airways was not my first choice for this trip to New York. Based on my previous experiences with them, I had explored other alternatives with a superior product (Qatar, Emirates and several EU carriers), but SAA is the only airline serving JFK non stop out of Johannesburg and I could not afford traveling 1-2 days vs the 15h direct flight. Having flown to and back from New York with them last week, I regret my choice for the following reasons: Airport services: OKish, uneventful check-in and boarding experience. SAA flies their old A340 600 to New York. Even though I purchased an emergency exit seat on both legs (45D, 45F resp) and had a very decent legroom, the experience was not pleasant as the seats were hard as a rock (even with lumbar support and additional pillows) and the aircraft clearly showed its age and it felt like its interior was falling apart. Inflight Entertainment more than half of the passengers travelling on my row complained about technical issues with their IFE system. Some of them simply didn't work, others like mine worked but with lag and poor sound. Not great when you have a 15h flight ahead of you. Cabin crew service: I did see a slight improvement vs. previous flights as crew seemed a bit nicer and more customer oriented. Don't think I would fly them again for such a long route again and will rather increase travel time by flying EU or Middle East carriers.",Detractor

At this point you will have 90 minutes before checking in. Give the normal 3 hours to check in but don't expect to see duty free as it will take you 3 hours of waiting.

When she helped a lady seating behind me to lay the bed back, she put the blanket around the side of my seat, somehow the blanket slapped my head and I was shocked, when I was seeing her she just realized and said sorry!

London Heathrow to Singapore. Brand New 777-300 very comfortable very clean. Entertainment was good and food tasty but very small portions. Staff functional but not friendly only one water run in 13 hours. Arrive early so cant complain. Better than Qantas flight Singapore to Brisbane.,Passive
GVA-CAI-BKK v.v. New 777-300ER on the long-haul - a real improvement. Very comfortable lie-flat seats in business fairly good IFE system a big step forward. Staff service seems to be improving too. On the way back it seemed like a number of business class seats were occupied by MS staff. Food - main course tasty while the first course seemed to be the same on every flight. They tried to give priority boarding for business passengers in Geneva airport but not well organized. Transfer at CAI airport the same as usual passing by the transfer desk even if already holding a boarding pass for the onward flight. Lounge ok flights on time. GVA-CAI-leg served by 737 as usual with still fairly good business class seating (2-2-configuration). All over not bad for the money paid.,Passive
YYZ to SYD via YVR in business class aboard 777-200 LR. Toronto to Vancouver leg was standard domestic business class experience. Ok food good entertainment nice service. Vancouver to Sydney was excellent. Nothing to complain about at all. Service was superb. Great meal service and a well stocked galley for between meal snacks. Tried the dim sum chicken breast skewers and fruit - all good. The pod seating is very comfortable. What really impressed was that the washrooms were so clean throughout the entire 15 hour flight. I used them frequently and they were always spotless. Air Canada really stepped it up on their international business class. To give you a comparison I've flown Singapore Airlines a few times and on this long haul flight Air Canada was even better (in both directions). I hope economy class had a good experience as well.,Promoter
"  I have enjoyed previous Virgin America flights and was looking forward to flying them from Seattle to Los Angeles. The plane was cramped and uncomfortable, and my seat didn't recline. No snacks on a 3 hour flight and 1 tiny cup of lukewarm coffee. Then a 20 min wait on the runway as our arrival gate was not available.",Detractor
 Denver to Orlanda. The seats were horribly uncomfortable and the food was overpriced. I will not recommend this airline for overnight or long flight.

"Manila to Istanbul via Doha. This is the first time for us to fly Qatar Airways since we've been flying Cathay Pacific for such a long time. There was barely a queue on business class. I approached a QR staff and asked if she could resolve my FFP issue. She was able to encode CX on the system. At least I was happy that my mileage earnings would be credited to my Marco Polo Account. We were then given our boarding pass and lounge access. We queued for the Immigration Checks, and that took us an hour for us to get through. When we get to the line for one particular immigration officer, there were like 6 people ahead of us and it took her forever to deal with each one of them. When it was our turn, it took less than 5 minutes. We walked like a couple of minutes to get to the PAGS Lounge and it appeared like the old Cathay Pacific Lounge - I was then told learned this was the old CX Lounge which needs a serious revamp! We were welcomed onboard warmly, although disappointed to see the seat configuration was 2-2-2. I was hoping that it was 1-2-1. Service was impeccable - simply impeccable. We preferred to have dinner an hour after take off. And when the meal service was on, I got so delighted with the breads. The Arabian Mezze was spot on and I got the second glass of Australian Shiraz. Unfortunately, the entrÃ©e was mundane. I would prefer a third glass of Shiraz and nuts over the main. Dessert was available, but I opted to get the cheese platter to pair with my Shiraz and it was divine. We touched down at Hamad International Airport at 9.30 in the evening. Deplaned and worked through to the transfer desk for the in-city accommodation which was provided by Qatar Airways. We checked in and were given a room at the top floor, the accommodation was decent. The toiletries were L'Occitane. After a quick shower, we dozed off as the wake up call is at 4am. At 4am, we got the wake up call and checked out. The airport transfer chauffeur took us back to the airport and it was like a breeze going through immigration and security checks. We tried the Qatar Airways Al Mourjan Lounge. When I entered, I got astounded with the sheer opulent details. The high ceiling, the furnishings and all that. Basing everything on In-Flight Service not the seat configuration and design and the whole experience, I would fly Qatar Airways Business class on my next long-haul flight.",Promoter
Houston to Delhi on 26th and it was quite impressive. Staff were attentive food was excellent and service excellent.

We flew on Christmas eve from London Gatwick - Jakarta - Perth. We arrived at the airport with a voicemail from them stating that we may not be able to get on our connecting flight due to stopping in Amsterdam on the way through. The voicemail told us to ask at the desk when we checked in but they had no idea what was going on either. Onto the flight getting on the plane was a disappointment it was old the seats had stains on and me and my family were seated apart and the crew had no interest in helping us. The meals were either over-cooked or cold the entertainment system needed updating with newer films and games etc. We were in the air for Christmas day and although we did not mind doing this there was no Christmas spirit on the flight not even a 'merry Christmas' from the captain when we landed. I understand that Indonesia is not a country which celebrates Christmas but it just would have been nice for them to acknowledge it. There isn't enough legroom for a long haul flight - if someone in front of you has their seat reclined you've got no chance of getting to sleep yourself. On the way back I was told that only 7kg of hand luggage was allowed even though on the way there there hadn't been a problem this resulted in me having to actually move 1.5 kilos out of my hand luggage to someone else's hand luggage that was in my party! What was the point? I was very disappointed with this airline as a whole. I would not fly Garuda Indonesia again.,Detractor
"The flight attendants were surly, service poor and the seating uncomfortable. The 747 had the new slim seats and the passenger in front of me had his seatback reclined the entire flight. The movie screen was so close to my face. The beverages were passed out in very small plastic glasses and rarely more than half full. One has to ask for 2-3 cups to get a healthy amount of fluids. The flight attendents hid behind the curtains much of the flight, discouraging passengers from walking in the aisles.",Detractor

"  Naples to Gatwick. I used to admire and love BA. I now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. I think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying Club Europe. My wife and I have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some Avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately not with blessings. We had, once again (!) been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife's preference states that she likes a window seat â€“ and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other â€“ but why does BA have to keep doing this? The trip as such started well enough in the new BA South Terminal Lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks, food and magazines. When time came for boarding and, amongst others, Club Europe passengers were invited to board first, there was no check made at all, which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. Once boarded, we were â€“ unlike the other Club Europe passengers â€“ not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished). When I opened my meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it. We took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess, who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. The meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. And whilst I do not object to being served wine from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has to ask for a refill, something not everybody likes to do. This practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost-cutting exercise. On previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for Club Europe passengers are available in airports like Corfu, Rhodes, Heraklion, even Seville (contrary to BA's website at the time â€“ we were told at all these airports â€˜ BA no longer pays for its passengers to have access') so, this time, my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in Naples. She was told No",Detractor
" Flight San Francisco to Vancouver was delayed by 2 hours 45 minutes, causing me to miss a connecting flight- the last of the day. This was not Alaska's fault, as the delay was ordered by SFO air traffic control. Alaska offered me another flight the next day from SFO, which I declined and, after a 2nd call, a flight from SEA the same day with a different airline, which I accepted. But after boarding the plane a mechanical issue arose, which took another 3.5 hours to resolve and again I missed connecting flight. Throughout Alaska did their best to keep us informed, they apologized profusely and they offered us food vouchers and complimentary food and drink of their own, including alcohol. It seemed they tried to do the best they could under the circumstances.",Passive
I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies. Now that AA have bought US Airways it will be doubly bad.,Detractor
"  Took the Air Shuttle (Puente AÃ©reo) between Barcelona and Madrid to go and come back in the same day. Check-in can be done up to 20 minutes before flight departure and the flight is about 50 minutes, which makes it really quick to get to Madrid and come back in the same day. The price is not cheap, but the total flexibility is worth it and being able to take which ever flight you want is great. Puente AÃ©reo is much faster than the high speed train and makes it easier to go and come back on the same day. I really recommend this service for passengers flying for business purposes.",Promoter

" I would like to make all potential Cathay Pacific customers aware of the embarrassing and rude customer service my husband and I received from a Cathay Pacific Customer Service Representative at the Hong Kong airport. We are on our way back from our honeymoon which original route was from USA to Hong Kong to Bangkok. The inflight experience is excellent at Cathay - unfortunately that is where that service and experience stops. We were mocked and spoken poorly about right in front of our faces and in front of other passengers for presenting our business class lounge ticket that was for â€œpost departureâ€ between our 11 hour layover from Bangkok. We had originally booked premium economy and were upgraded to business for the short flight (BKK to HKG). When they did this the check in attendant gave us passes to the lounge for when we arrive in Hong Kong, which was very helpful since we landed at 10:50 and don't depart until 9:30 the next morning. This was never honored. Instead, we have been waiting in the airport and finally went to the lounge when it opened at 5:30am and were turned away because our flight that got in last night at 10:50 was only good for the lounge until midnight (about 1 hour), when our flight to America leaves at 9am. The representative stopped us from going in the lounge and did not do it in a nice way at all. No recommendation on where to go, no sympathy for us waiting around all night to finally get into the lounge. The saddest part of it all, is the demeanor and attitude change as soon as she saw my American passport. She and her friend immediately started talking and laughing in another language. This was very uncomfortable. This has been a horrible experience overall starting off with our bags being lost and never leaving the USA when we started our honeymoon travels in Bangkok. We had to go looking for clothes around Bangkok for the first half of the day since we were without any luggage. I think the biggest fear of two newlyweds on the other side of the country with oversize baggage (that I paid $150usd to cover for) showed up with 0 bags. Needless to say, the experience has been on edge and not relaxing whatsoever due to all of the mishaps. The inflight team is wonderful and makes sure you are taken care of, if only the Cathay Pacific team was all well-verses in how to take care of two customers that have chosen to travel around the world with them.",Detractor

The service is rushed and unfriendly, and as a premium economy flyer, the only difference between economy seems to be priority boarding and a slightly bigger seat.

Frankfurt to Toronto. Positive: Customer service was efficient and courteous spacious clean and comfortable aircraft. Negatives: Horrible food - absolutely atrocious - We were served a hot meal shortly after departure and because the flight was booked they ran out of different meal options so by the time they served the back of the cabin not only was the food cold but we were not given any meal options. Apparently there was a chicken dish available but we were served a disgusting pasta Bolognese dish. The roll was stale and the side was some form of potatoes which had been reconstituted from potato flakes. Apparently others on the flight had similar issues with the chicken dish which tasted like rubber and a salad which had wilted. It was extremely disappointing and I did not eat any of it. Later on we were served Air Canada's 'signature' tortilla/wrap by Monty's which also tasted horrible and is worse than a pizza pocket. The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can. I understand that many individuals have varying dietary requirements and allergies but perhaps Air Canada should invest in a dietician or nutritional consultant to encourage healthy eating on the go while meeting the needs of their customers.,Passive

We then had to wait to rebook and dealt with a very incompetent front desk lady. After it took her 45 minutes to rebook us we had to find a hotel, the airline didn't even offer to pay for it even though it was their fault our flight was cancelled.

Other customers may not give you the most pleasant experience (a lot of noisy tour groups) but that is not within airline's control. They gave out pillows if you need. Blankets can be taken off plane if you want. One thing I dont like about this airline is their lack of control on how many cabin luggages a customer can bring in. So many customers brought 2 to 3 big bags that cannot even fit in cabin and a lot of customers were not able to use the cabin due to these greedy customers. It will be dangerous if this plane were to get any accident if you need to evacuate but you will probably get jammed along the way because too many luggage blocking the path.

Both take-off and landing were smooth, and I like those purple LED lights during those times. Everything is smooth, comfy. Decent domestic flight for me.",Passive
"Hong Kong to Copenhagen via Doha return, Xmas and New Year 2015. The product was stable and predictable and almost fully punctual arrivals. Economy class has poorer food and drink choices. No menu provided, 2-3 options of hot meals offered despite small portions. Service onboard was top notch. three of the four flights were full but the cabin staff managed servicing passengers satisfactorily. Transfer in Doha was slightly better (airbridges 3 times out of 4). Recognised as elite FFP flyer and offered a free upgrade between CPH and DOH due to overbooking in economy. However, I was told that I could not use the upgrade offer as I was travelling with a child on a separate booking. Child meals and toys for kids provided to perfection. Seating arranged well and proactively well adjusted as needed by staff due to full flights. The lounges for Oneworld Elite customers in Doha are substandard . Codeshare and cooperation with the Oneworld partners Cathay Airways and Dragonair faultless in terms of booking, miles crediting, luggage transfers.",Promoter
London Gatwick - Funchal return. Internet check in was a breeze 48 hours before departure. Bag drop at LGW was handled quickly and courteously and although TAP's website stated only one cabin bag was permitted I was allowed to take on a small cabin bag and laptop. Aircraft was an A320 less than half full. Pushback on time and flight time about 3 hrs 15 mins. Cabin crew were friendly albeit largely invisible after breakfast which was a very small savoury roll and yoghurt drink. No personal IFE drop down screens every 4th or 5th row showed a few programs but mostly flight mapping. Return journey from FNC lunchtime departure on a half full A319 pushback 10 minutes early. Snack size hot pasta and fruit puree dessert served midway through the flight. Otherwise pretty much as per the outward journey.,Passive
" Time to pick your game up Air NZ. I recently took Air NZ to Japan and back. The trip out was ok, window seat was comfortable enough. The trip back was a different matter. Centre aisle seat and very hard and uncomfortable. Unfriendly Air Hostesses who were abrupt and absolutely no help whatsoever. I apparently tried to use the wrong bathroom and was told in no uncertain terms it wasn't for me and to use the other one. This left me feeling like a 5yo who had just been told off by his mother, no courtesy at all. Then the meal announcements which they announced wrong 4 times before getting it right. And it's pronounced rat-a-tooy not rat-a-tooly. The NZ accent was so bad I wanted to shrink into my seat, a 14yo old school girl would sound better. I was absolutely embarrassed. Then at 6am offering coffee service but when I ordered it (which was as soon as it appeared on my screen) I was informed the kitchen was closed. Are you kidding me, what kitchen would that be? It's a coffee pot! I realised then I had not seen one person served anything at all besides the meal. Get rid these lazy over paid idiots, sack your trainer and start looking at other airlines to see what service is all about. Time to ditch the hokey kiwi manner and accent, get professional Air NZ. You are getting tired and self important and it is obvious. I won't be flying international Air NZ after this awful experience.",Detractor
SIN to BNE in October 2013. Check-in was pretty uneventful. As for the flight itself I did not expect to have my economy seat to feel so cramped. Maybe because of the dark brown color scheme that it felt so cramped. Also that distinct Middle Eastern aircraft smell made my allergies act up throughout the flight. I wasn't able to enjoy the inflight entertainment because of my allergic condition. The meals were ok but nothing spectacular. Overall pretty much an average airline for economy class despite all the hoopla and press releases about it.,Passive
"  I have flown Southwest in the past and never had problems with it. However, this last trip was very upsetting due to the very rude customer service. We had a flight from Chicago to Dallas and then to El Paso which is home for us. From Chicago to Dallas as we started approaching Dallas the weather conditions became difficult and we knew we were going to have delays. It took an hour to land and I completely understand and would never complain about the fact that there are delays due to weather and also due to keeping us safe. Once we landed our next flight was delayed for about an hour. So we hung around and waited. Then it got delayed for another half hour, 45 minutes, then delayed for 15 more minutes, etc. The delays kept coming, then finally they said we were going to board. So they told us they would be ready to board but they couldn't find a pilot. This was at around 11:30 pm. So they kept saying a pilot was on his way and any minute now we will board. Around 1 am I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled. I wish it could have gotten cancelled earlier so we could make accommodations as to where to sleep. I don't understand how you don't have a pilot. And if that's the case, then please just tell us with time so we can make accommodations. People started running to Southwest counters and we were notified that only 2 counters were open. They said you can call and rebook or wait in line at the counter. I called as I waited in line and they told me they could not assist me over the phone because I had a bag checked in. When the counters opened everybody ran to the counter and I had to pick up my 5 year old who was asleep on the floor so by the time I got to the counter I was toward the end of the line. I stood in line until about 3:45 am. When it was finally my turn, the staff was extremely rude. They treated us like we should be grateful they were even lifting a finger for us. The first lady I talked to was Chinese and had broken English. As soon as I walked up she rolled her eyes at me. Before I even spoke. I felt contempt seeing as I was the one who had been standing in line close to 4 hours. But I am a nice person so I decided to smile and be polite anyway. I asked her to please rebook my flight as early as possible and she gave me 2 options: one for 7 am departure connecting at Austin which was already delayed or one for 7 pm direct flight. I told her I was skeptical about the 7 am one since it was already delayed but 7 pm is such a long time to wait when you don't have anywhere to sleep or shower and my luggage is checked in. She gave me a look of not my problem tapped her fingers on the counter and told me to pick one. I asked her if they could help accommodate us so we could sleep somewhere and at this she became very angry and told me ""we aren't going to give you anything!"" She treated me like I was trying to get some ""advantage"" of the situation. I just wanted a place to sleep, and if there's nothing to be done there is a way to state things politely. I told her I needed to think it over and I would come back but really I wanted to not be taken care of by her. I went back in line and got another representative. He was a little bit nicer but he also kept chatting to the guy next to him for long periods of time as if I wasn't there. Maybe the system was reloading or maybe he was just ignoring me. I saw a lot of people crying and I don't blame them. We slept at the airport until boarding time.",Detractor
"  Toronto to London Heathrow. I am a BA Exec Silver member and paid over Â£2,500 return for Business flight, as had work straight after flying both journeys. Originally was a Boeing 787, but they changed planes to an old Boeing 777 on both journeys. The 'flat' business seat on YYZ-LHR was broken and Cabin Service Director couldn't fix it. The bench part was 5 inches different level to main seat. Extremely uncomfortable and didn't sleep a wink. No extra pillows available in either Business or First. Food inedible on both journeys. Outbound fillet of British Beef was as tough as old rope. They should be ashamed of the Business breakfast on the YYZ-LHR as I've had better in a greasy Joe's cafe. Also, the wine printed on the menu not available on both legs. A case of over-promising and under-delivering again. Simply miles behind the competition. The CSD completed a complaint for me and I also wrote to Alex Cruz. Their Customer Services Team offered me Â£50 in vouchers. What planet is he on? Now they have a very angry and dissatisfied customer. It is not the money, it is the principle.",Detractor
  London Gatwick to Stockholm. All three flights so far wih Norwegian has run smoothly. But this flight D82852 on February 8 was sinking the rating of Norwegian as we entered the cabin. The crew was disorganised and there was not enough space overhead for the cabin luggage. Either Norwegian hasn't designed the aircraft to fit all cabin luggage in the cabin or they are not making sure that people stick to the rules of carrying hand luggage. So we came in to our pre-booked front seat rows and find that the overhead storage isn't designed for normal sized cabin luggage and already there is one smaller bag and a ladies handbag stuffed in there. The cabin staff tells me to follow her colleague further back to store my luggage there. Another staff says there is no room for our luggage down there. When I finally get back to my seat the staff confirms they need to check our hand luggage in. I need to take out my laptop and our valuables. After takeoff I realise that the luggage stored overhead of us belongs to the cabin crew. I have to admit that yesterday's flight from Fuerteventura to London with a half full cabin did have one of the smoothest communicating crews I have seen in work lately.,Detractor
"âŒ   Having been a dyed in the wool Virgin fan, I was eager to see how Alaska measured up. They didn't. I flew back from Philly on a Sunday evening (7:45 scheduled departure). The flight didn't take off until 10 p.m. I wasn't notified via text until 6:30 that it was delayed (same thing happened on the flight from SFO to Philly). Had I been notified a bit earlier, I could have stayed and had dinner with my son before going to the airport. How is it passengers aren't notified sooner than an hour before the flight that there are system wide delays due to air traffic control issues in Philly that had been an issue for hours on both flights? Worse yet, I flew First Class and was looking forward to seeing how it matched up with Virgin. Sadly, no comparison at least no in this flight. While the flight attendant was good, they seemed totally unprepared for passengers. He had to go to the back to get mixers each time. Dinner was a mess. I got the vegetarian entree I didn't order, followed 25 minutes later by part of my original order which was stone cold. Perhaps it was because they transition isn't yet complete, but regardless, Alaska has a long way to go before earning my family's loyalty.",Detractor
Flying OZ221 following by OZ741 from JFK to BKK via ICN and 742/222 on the way back in Business class both way. I can say that Asiana had met or exceed my expectation for all the flights during my trip. Especially for the long hual from JFK to ICN (222/221) I had the 180 flat bed (new 1-2-1 configuration ) and great food (surprisingly I can get good medium steak on the airplane). In-flight staffs are very responsive and feel warm welcome. The downside is the ICN-BKK section is on the older plane without AVOD system. I would defiantly fly with them again in the future.,Promoter
"Flight from Montreal YUL to Paris CDG was uneventful. We departed on time and we enjoyed our first experience flying in Premium Economy with Air Canada. The seats were relatively comfortable, with ample legroom and recline. The meal after departure was delicious (chicken curry, edamame beans, rice, with salad, roll and cake). The service was quite good, albeit a bit rushed. A light breakfast was served with banana bread and yogurt, although I expected a bit more for premium economy. The IFE was average, with not a lot of options.There is no divider between PE and Economy but overall we enjoyed our experience.

"  Gatwick to Orlando return. Possibly the worst pre and post flight experience I can remember. 4 hrs late on the way out, almost three hours late on the return journey. BAs use of old aircraft is to blame. A failed IFE that couldn't be repaired took two hours to try and remedy. After this failed, a replacement plane was required. By the time this arrived, BA realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours. This led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew. This was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by BA. No refreshments provided, no accurate information, just endless waiting. They didn't board the children first and it was a total mess. The plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to Tampa due to low fuel. Whilst this seems fair enough, the plane was actually 1hr late leaving Gatwick in the first place so had it left on time, it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did. A terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called British as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as I can see. I will not be using BA again.",Detractor

We have traveled twice in the last two months on this airline and found the service to be extremely slow the food awful. On our last trip we were in the air for over 6 hrs and I turned on my overhead light for service (another drink) only had one to that point as that was all that offered up till then. To be told we would be landing in 1 hr and I could wait till then and could my drinks for free at the resort. Very rude comment and also we were only landing to drop off people at Punta Cana and still had approx. another 3 hrs of air time. All four trips (2 to point of destination and 2 return) they had run out of tomato juice before they had got to our row 11. The movies were bad and then to have to watch 3 same re-runs of a sitcom after - that's bad.

" Austin to Miami. We will never fly American Airlines again. I would have loved to write a review on American airlines website to tell them about my experience however American airlines only gives you 7 days from your flight date to write a review. I couldnt have within this time frame since I was still on vacation internationally. This flight I'm referring to was on 4/8 from Austin to Miami. From the very beginning it was the most rocky turbulent flight I have ever been on. All the people around us was commenting on the turbulence. The plane then drops and then shoots up again. The pilot came on the intercom and said. ""Sorry about that folks, we were a little to close to the plane in front of us. We will have to circle around and try to land again. It will be about 5 minutes"". We finally land and we took forever to taxi to get off the plane. We had another flight to catch and we had hoped to still make it. No one on the intercom told us anything about our connecting flight. We had to run from gate 19 to gate 49. We had 8 minutes to spare and the plane was already pulling away. They did not call our names over the intercom or call out for final boarding. They just left even though it wasn't our fault. We ran to the next gate to tell them but they just told us there isnt anything they can do and to go to the rebooking center. Then we had to walk back to gate 37 to the rebooking center. We talked to the agent told them what happened. She has no sympathy, no compassion and a huge attitude. We rebooked for a few hours later.

Flying Bangkok - Helsinki - Bangkok in Business. I already knew that they are going to use that old ageing A340 that used to serve Air France before so I did not expect much. However the food was quite nice. Wines were good and cabin staff were OK. Seat was bad like I knew beforehand but it was alright as it was a day flight. Entertainment system was very bad worst I've seen. I know that they are going to replace the plane next year but still it was not a very good experience in regards of flying in Business. They should have provided at least some Tablets for entertainment etc. Return flight was worse: It was too hot and the Asian-Western - fusion menu was not good. I didn't want any rice or noodles I wanted to eat something good quality - European/Western prime meat or some Mediterranean fresh dishes combined with good nice wine most of the 3 mains were oriental style and the selection was worse than inbound flight.

ONT-SLC-CDG-AMS-MME on 2-3 December (some of the flights were on AF and KL metal but it was a Delta ticket with DL flight numbers for all the segments). An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,Promoter

Flew from YYZ to SJO longest 5.5 hrs ever. I have flown to SJO 7 times and that was the worst flight.

Apparently the plane Rouge sends to San Jose Costa Rica is not big enough or powerful enough to take off full if the wind is blowing towards the mountains if they had tried we would have crashed into the mountains.

The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely.

I was also told that I can't speak to a supervisor or manager. They said if I fill out the online form that a supervisor will contact me - I'm still waiting. I have emailed twice. Once they replied that it is being dealt with, the other they said that as the flight wasn't delayed that I'm not due any compensation - what the hell, they obviously didn't even read my email as it was the refund for a ticket they cancelled that I am chasing. The ratings don't allow me to put down zero otherwise I would. The customer service is ridiculous, and management is cowardly for not dealing with real issues. To wait for 7 weeks to be refunded money is pathetic.",Detractor
"We flew airbus A380 Manchester-Dubai and returned on the 777. Both planes were excellent and the entertainment system was 2nd to none. I found the seats to be adequate although I have read some concerns about the width we did not find this but both my wife and myself are average height and build at 5 ft 10"". We were however lucky enough on our return journey to have booked just 2 adjoining seats at the rear of the plane which we found really good as there was a bit more room at that point in the aisle as well and we were far enough away from the toilets not to be annoyed by any queue. However my only gripe would be the complimentary drink situation If you are happy to have a drink just when the food is served then its not a problem for you but my wife and myself do like a drink more often than this and class a 7 hour flight with great entertainment almost as one of our nights out (especially on the outward bound flight) Now I don't know what other people would say is over the top but I would quite easily get through 6 or 7 of the little wine bottles they provide in this period of time but found it hard to be served 3. I really did have to keep asking to get any more and on 2 occasions was acknowledged but no wine brought to us. I would have quite happily purchased some at this point but obviously its all complimentary so I couldn't even do this. I have a suspicion that the staff are trained to spot people who may want more alcohol than what they deem to be average consumption and enforce delay tactics to slow you down and felt they were avoiding eye contact with me when passing. They ignored the ""call service"" light on our seat completely and I had to eventually keep getting up and going to the galley where they were. This did spoil the flight to some extent as even when we are on a flight where we have to pay we would have had more than this The food however was again very good.",Promoter
" I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible. Touchscreen is based on a mouse cursor on screen. If you touch a particular button, you need to do it a few times so that the cursor will understand that it should be at your thumb. Hence, a difficult screen to control.",Detractor
"  The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home. A journey memorable for all the wrong reasons.",Detractor

SAS did a super job getting us from Copenhagen to Newark NJ on busy Boxing Day 2014. At CPH airport long lines moved well and the check-in staff person was cheerful and efficient despite the crush. After boarding the pilot kept us informed of a delay and then we were off to a fine flight with helpful flight staff. Just don't get seated next to the toilet on an Airbus 340 (the single one on the window side facing passenger in middle row economy section). That passenger was me. I didn't pick it but was assigned it upon online check-in. Airbus designed it well enough even with a positive closing door it only takes a nudge. People are slobs though every fourth one could not be bothered to nudge the door shut as they exited leaving me to push it shut throughout the flight.,Promoter

" Sydney to London via Singapore. My partner and I flew business class in the forward section of the upper deck. Boarding was quick. Full business class section. The service from all flight staff was fantastic. A couple of times the Flight Service Manager came around to say hi and inquire how the service was. And the service was top notch. Requesting a couple of drinks along the way was no hassle. The meals really tasty. The barramundi fish especially was cooked to perfection. But to top such a long flight off, land at Heathrow, off the aircraft and out the front of Terminal 3 within half an hour. Great flights.",Promoter
JFK-IAD ERJ-195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom. It was a short flight of about 50 minutes. There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight.

My journey was from BOM to LHR (I had a connecting flight from LHR to MIA surprisingly enough the transit at LHR wasn't all that bad). Aircraft 777-200. Got a complimentary upgrade from World Traveler to World Traveler Plus. The seat was good and spacious service was professional and the food was nice especially the English breakfast that was served prior to landing. The only drawback was the absence of overhead air vents which at times made it a little stuffy and the in-flight entertainment which lacked the variety of Emirates for example. Overall a pleasant experience. Wouldn't mind flying with BA again at all.,Promoter

LHR-ICN my first class flight experience and was expecting something very special. Reality was a disappointment and not much better than business class - certainly not worth considerable extra expense or air miles. Seats recline to 180 degrees instead of 160 for business but otherwise everything is the same. Discovered that the seat next to me which was empty at takeoff was marked with a sign for flight attendants to rest! Attendants resting in first class? Service from the attendants was super-smiley and Koreans are renowned for their hospitality - almost too much at times and it can be hard to get some peace and privacy. Cutlery was strange : metal forks and spoons but plastic knives which I suspect were recycled. I know that metal knives are a security issue but other airlines use blunt-ended metal ones in business. Food was certainly no better than business class and the whole experience was similar to KLM business class without the grumpy KLM flight attendants.,Passive
Flew with my business partner AKL-LAX-AKL in Premium Economy on 777-300. Boarding was stress free both sides as we were Premium Economy plus Star Alliance Gold and Koru members so either way we were first on the plane. The flight attendants were available and were there to help right from the start with overhead locker storage etc. Main meals were delivered shortly after take off both ends and the quality of the meals were very similar if not the same to what I've had in business class with each course brought out separately. Quality of the alcohol was good plus it was nice to have a good mug of tea coffee and after dinner mints afterwards. Amenity Packs were the same as in business class. The seat is multi adjustable and obviously nowhere near lie flat but after some adjustment got a nice sleeping position. The seat and footwells accommodated my 6 foot 2 inch frame my only criticism was the footwell that narrows wouldn't accommodate my size 12's so take your shoes off and rest your feet on the bean bag supplied. The crew both ways were excellent. The quality of service was excellent. The seats being pod design mean your personal space is not encroached on I am disappointed to hear that Premium Economy seating on their Dreamliner or the 777-200 upgrades will not be using this type of seating.,Promoter

"I understand the business model for Air Canada's decision to launch a ""low cost"" leisure (vacation) airline to popular vacation destinations in USA South and Europe. Their 'regular' Air Canada flights are staffed by more experienced (and expensive) crews with higher salaries and benefits such as employee pension plans and expensive to operate and maintain in-flight entertainment systems. Air Canada was having trouble competing on many of these routes served by other vacation airlines such as Air Transat Sun Wing and some charters. In my opinion the airline had another reason - their fleet of Airbus A319 and Boeing 767 aircraft were growing old and tired and needed new duties while Air Canada began a program of planning for their eventual replacement at the main airline with the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft types. Hence Rouge was born. I have been a loal Air Canada customer for over 30 years -- even travelled with them to Mexico which was excellent - but this Rouge experiment leaves a bad taste in my mouth and aches in my legs and back. The refurbished Rouge cabins on these planes have more rows of seats which means less leg room. Cramped and uncomfortable on a long flight to your vacation is not my ideal way of arriving. While the flight crew at Rouge are very attentative and friendly I feel pity for them that they have to deal with passenger complaints that are mostly no fault of their own. I recently flew Air Transat to Jamaica in a nice comfortable wide-body A330 with lots of leg room and a big seat-back free entertainment system all with refurbished cabins with soothing colours and advanced lighting to limit effects of jet lag. Lots of overhead storage space too. Fourth time I flew with them and never been disappointed. Rouge needs to change soon or they will just go to the place in the sky where many other airlines have gone before them to die. Rouge was supposed to be a ""new airline"" according to Air Canada.",Detractor
"Ontario to Sacramento. This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations. He then stated, ""Sorry but there is nothing that he can do"". He didn't even try to make it right but rather tried to come up with different excuses. Also he knew very little about the policies as I was placed on hold several times while he consulted with another co-worker.

Flight crew were less friendly to passengers fewer smiles yet one of the FAs stood out very well in performance. The seats were a lot of worst with thinner padding making it extremely uncomfortable to lean your back all the way. The restrooms were awful unlike the first leg which was spotless. The same goes with the cleanliness of the cabins. Overall flying with Delta would mean riding old planes and comfort is less of a priority in economy class.

" I flew QF72 from Singapore to Perth and the flight was extremely full (possibly due to the school holidays). Business class passengers were asked to board first (after families with young children) and this is probably not a good idea as passengers in economy have to file past and queue through the front cabin in this single aisle B737-800. It really is not a suitable aircraft for this very popular international route. After all passengers were seated we were offered a pre-departure drink, an amenities kit but no newspapers or cold/hot towels. Soon after take-off, drink and dinner orders were taken but the menu choices for business class took me by surprise - three seafood choices (fish dumpling soup, salmon salad or a prawn roll) with only one meat choice (pork) for main course. Entree was a choice of soup or chicken salad - I elected to have the chicken salad and it was very nice. Not being terribly keen on seafood, I chose the pork for main course, however, it had already run out (as was the case for another passenger) so I eventually chose the prawn and celery roll. It was served cold and possibly the worst airline meal I have ever eaten. Basically it was a hot-dog roll with a few chopped prawns scattered over the top - totally tasteless and inedible. Drinks were topped up from time to time during the meal service, however, more attention was given to passengers after the the meal service was completed which is totally understandable. As there is no division/curtain between business and economy there seems to be quite a lot of traffic through the forward cabin so there is little chance of taking a rest in these domestic style seats. Fortunately the passenger in front of me did not fully recline his seat as was the case on the Perth - Singapore sector earlier in the year. Overall, the crew did their very best to take care of passengers, however, as mentioned before, this small aircraft doesn't really seem appropriate for this very competitive and busy international sector. I sincerely hope Qantas considers the reinstatement of their A330's sometime in the future. In the meantime, the business class menu choices need to be urgently reviewed (as does a division/curtain between cabins).",Passive

We asked for a complaint form in Bangkok and in Beijing, but the answere was that they don't such a thing, and that they don't understand why they have to have one - because they don't understand why we want to complain, just because of the extra hours. All said in a very rude way and in a very poor English (if you get a person that speaks English, of course). The planes are old, not confortable at all (unless you are in 1987), the crew was useless (hardly speak english) and give you orders like you were at the army. We got seats at the exit door, where there was a powerful light. We was told that they would gave us an eyemask to let us sleep. We had to ask for it 4 times, and they just threw them to us.

Toronto to Varadero and back. It is unbelievable how much they are willing to test the patience of their travelers. I'm only 5'5 and I found the seats to be extremely cramped. I could barely handle the 3.5 hour flight - I don't know how people handle a 7-8 hour flight. While the staff were helpful and friendly I was shocked that you have to pay for food and alcohol pay for a blanket and pay for on board entertainment. Why are we moving backwards. I remember the time when there used to be one large screen for an entire section then we progressed to individual entertainment systems and now we aren't back to square one - but we have regressed! If you are going to start cutting corners like this then at least reduce the airfare! What is Air Canada thinking? Never again.,Detractor
Checked in for my flight at Rome International Airport to Auckland New Zealand via Hong Kong. Queued to board when a Cathay Pacific hostess said there was a delay to go have lunch then return at 1pm. I returned at 1pm. My flight was still not boarding and no staff present. Waited a further 2 hours before any staff were present to answer questions. Told the flight had been delayed until 9am the next morning to go to the Hilton hotel and those with connecting flights will receive information once there. No explanation for the delay. In the morning we were told that connecting flights would be arranged once we landed at Hong Kong. No boarding gate was given security would not let us through as our boarding passes were for the day before Cathay Pacific staff failed to inform them we were coming. Once at the gate we were told of a further delay until 4pm. Told there were no seats on that days flight to Hong Kong. I was informed my connecting flight from Hong Kong to Auckland would be rescheduled and would be available when I landed. This did not happen. Staff at Hong Kong put me on a later flight. I am extremely annoyed at how the situation was handled. I will never fly Cathay Pacific again.,Detractor

One major annoyance was the removable tablet on the seat frame which got in the way of my left arm and which restricted movement.

"  Malaga to Gatwick. They've introduced new cabin baggage allowances. Ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like scuffle. They now charge for food. This would be fine if it didn't take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane. On my previous three flights with 'the new BA' we've been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any service. As the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets, there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane. On the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. The cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. One of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew service. This has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company, giving them no time (or energy, by the look of it) to be nice. Ultimately, if price is everything make sure you check Norwegian before you spend any money with BA. If price isn't everything don't fly BA.",Detractor

Web check and bag drop at Lisbon Portela worked fine (Lisbon terminal 1 is great on departure). Warm welcome from crew with on time departure and early arrival into Nice. Only negatives were the old plane (an old Fokker) and the food (hot dinner of bacalhau fish pie. Bit stodgy for my liking. Crew warm and attentive and not stingy with the wine. Bonus about this old plane was the legroom and seat cushioning- obviously pre-dates the days of beancounters running airlines! Not sure about flying them longhaul though (flew Lufthansa from Rio to Europe enroute from NZ and they were competent). Great value for money paid.

After being unable to eat and told once I go through security I cannot come out I went through security to find an in a massively overcrowded terminal with no air conditioning and people covered with sweat sitting all over floors waiting 7 hours with nowhere to set with no air conditioning was awful. There were long lines even for the filthy toilets. There was never an explanation or apology from Copa staff.

Again with a previous domestic flight the four of us were given seat allocations scattered all over the cabin that is until after a long and tedious discussion with service desk. Boarding control was hopeless. No microphone and people jammed up the entrance to hear the announcements only in Bahasa. A large Indonesian party just walked though without boarding control which lead to delays until head counts finally reconciled passenger numbers. Our usual pet hate again. When is Garuda going to enforce carry on baggage restrictions? Passengers brought excessive number of bags that were so overweight that they could not lift the bags into overhead lockers. Just as well they were some tall and strong Caucasians to stow luggage around the cabin. We have learnt our lesson travelling economy class on internal flights in Indonesia with Garuda is not value for money other low fare airlines could not be worse.,Detractor
Last November I flew with Egyptair 4 times: between Madrid and Cairo Cairo and Luxor Aswan and Cairo and finally between Cairo and Madrid. One negative point is that Egyptair cut the direct route from Cairo to Lisbon so nowadays passengers have to catch the plane in Barajas. The main flights (MAD-CAI-MAD) were regular: the route was operated by two aircraft's B737-800 which were clean and comfortable but the crews weren't polite or friendly. The food was a bit spicy like everything in Egypt. First flight was delayed about 30 minutes but the plane arrived on time to Cairo. After that flight I had to catch another one this time to Luxor. It was a stopover of about 1h30 minutes on Cairo. The flight between Cairo and Luxor also on a B737-800 was a mess because the seats mentioned on check-in that was made previously on Madrid weren't the real ones on this flight. As a result we were put on different seats on this short flight of 1 hour duration. Flight between Aswan and Cairo was on a Embraer 190 of Egyptair Express and went OK. Once again the plane was clean and comfortable but the crews were more friendly to passengers. In generally the all experience on Egyptair was regular. The airplanes were clean and comfortable the crews should be more friendly the food was a bit spicy and the entertainment was none because the planes didn't have individual screens. It was a regular experience: not very bad but not very good also.,Passive

Service Director was a gem very gracious. But the rest of the front cabin crew didn't seem to want to be there. Eye contact & smiles were absent and the environment lacked any genuine sense of welcome. We took off after midnight and I opted for the express meal which was adequate but not great.

There was a fair amount of trash (newspapers plastic wrappers boarding cards) from the previous flight around my seat and in the overhead bin. The bathrooms were in poor condition.

Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with Ã¢stuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.,Promoter
" New York to Gatwick. A complete shambles from start to finish. After booking premium seats with Norwegian to travel to and from New York we received an email a couple of days before departure to say the flight had been changed and would be operated by Wamos. My friend and I had never heard of them but looking at reviews of the airline we decided not to travel with them and changed to Norwegian a day earlier, thus incurring the cost of an extra night in the New York hotel. For comfort/entertainment / food and cabin crew the Norwegian flight was average. The day before returning from NY on the 18th September we received an email to say the flight had once again been changed, our seats downgraded to economy and the flight would be operated by Air Europa. After setting up a chat to Norwegian the agent informed us that the next available Norwegian flight would not be until 24th September and no premium seats would be available until 29th September. Basically the agent was not interested and abruptly terminated the chat in mid sentence. We telephoned Norwegian and during the call were passed to two different agents who were both unhelpful. We were offered the usual 75% refund etc etc. Looking into those options it seems passengers have to wait an awfully long time to receive any compensation. We arrived at JFK for our flight earlier than advised and spent 30 minutes with the check in agents endeavouring to get our premium seats reinstated. We were lucky but there would have been 20+ passengers who would have not been so lucky. The Air Europa aircraft was had seen better days, had very limited entertainment, no pre ordered food, and my friends seat was broken. The only positive was the crew who seemed professional and helpful. There seems to be no point in booking a premium seat with Norwegian as it is a complete lottery as to whether you will get one. In fact it will be pot luck whether it will be Norwegian Air or one of the more obscure airlines they are using to replace many of their flights. I would never fly with them again.",Detractor
"  Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow in Club Europe business class. A weekend evening flight that was quite empty.

I realize that preparing food in the air presents particular challenges, but I don't know why airlines serve overcooked and underseasoned dishes. My main gripe with Cathay is with the ground service, which is non-existent. The First lounges are hard to find and not worth the trouble as the service and food are limited and worse than in business. For goodness sake: Even at the home airport of Hong Kong, there was no help with finding how to transit or to find the lounge.

Round trip to New York (EI 105/104). Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.,Passive

Finnair should offer flat beds to HKG when they offer it on the BKK route which is more of a leisure destination than HKG.

I will travel with AY again when they have installed flat beds throughout their entire long haul fleet. Until then I will stick to CX OZ and TG.,Passive
" Ljubljana to Brussels. Absolutely terrible. Online check-in was unclear and the summary of booking information, which I carefully went through in the morning of my flight, contained no information about it being necessary to avoid a 30â‚¬ payment at the airport. I was first given a boarding pass with no problems when I arrived at Ljubljana airport and the boarding to the plane was about to start, as suddenly I was called to information situated outside the security. I was called to pay the 30â‚¬ because I had done the check-in at the airport (paper? The 2-second service?), and given no option to fight back because my flight was about to leave. I was treated like an idiot because I had not figured out that online check-in was needed while apparently having ""ticked the box"" to agree to do it online while booking. Apparently I would have figured this out by logging into their website. As if I had nothing better to do with my time than browsing their website just for fun. This was my first time with Wizz air and I had no idea this company had all these different ways to trick the customers. They probably make a fortune with the misleading check-in information.

We had brought the connecting plane tickets with the understanding that the connecting flight will wait for us. It did not. They closed the gate by 5 seconds before we got to the connecting gate and would not allow us to get on suggesting that they have cancelled our ticket. When we mentioned our situation, there was no help, and security was called. Just terrible. Do not count on getting any help or any service from Finair staff.

Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations. Not on par as Singapore, Emirates and Asian carriers but solidly good overall.",Passive
LAX-FLL-LAX round trip. Service was top notch with boarding efficiency inflight service food and IFE well above US standards.

I used to only fly united but my last trip will be the last tome I fly United. I booked a trip to Las Vegas and the flight was delayed. United re-routed my flight through Delta. Delta offered complimentary TV and snacks more leg room and I didn't feel as if I was sitting on my neighbors lap.

May 23rd 2015 we flew Air Canada enroute Fort Lauderdale - Ottawa - Frankfurt. From FLL to Ottawa we flow with an E-190 and Ottawa - Frankfurt with 767-300ER. All flights were on time without any delays. FLL-Ottawa: The Flight was full. A lot of cruise passengers were on board this flight. We had the last row in this small aircraft. The restrooms were at the end and they were very busy. Ottawa-Frankfurt: The Service was very poor. We had a Seat in the last row and we got only veggie meals. Unfortunately they had no more meat meals for us. The beverages were poor too. No more Coke Zero after 1/3 off flight time. They had enough Alcohol on Board.,Detractor
"â Unverified | New York to Seoul via Shanghai. My experience flying with China Eastern was not a great one, particularly because of the small seats and the lack of decent entertainment to choose from. My shoulders were nearly in the seats next to me and it was a battle for the armrest for the 14 and 16 hour flights. The seats seemed very firm and weren't comfortable to rest in at all. It didn't help that the Chinese woman next to me kept spitting into a cup, making the loudest noises ever to do so. Aside from the small seats in Economy, the movie selection was not great by any means. I was able to choose from a couple that I found interesting, but I ran out of viable options pretty quickly thereafter. Lastly, I had purchased my tickets 5 months before the trip actually took place and had chosen aisle seats for every flight. On my way to New York, I was given my aisle seats. But on the way back, I was sat in a middle row seat, in the middle of the plane, for both legs of the trip. I was not at all thrilled. It didn't help that I became ill on the flight and was not able to freely walk around whenever I pleased. Overall, if it were up to me, I would never fly with China Eastern again. But with their prices being so low, it can be hard to pass up sometimes.",Detractor
Flew from Montreal to Nice and then Rome to Montreal. Didn't realize when I booked that Rouge was AC's new discount holiday carrier. My fault. But really shocked at the age of the planes with the old drop down ceiling screens. I knew they had the new inflight streaming entertainment Westjet is going this way too but I didn't realize it was because the planes were so old! Don't think they have been cleaned since they were new either the floors crevices bathrooms walls of both planes were filthy. My seat from Rome was broken and slanted towards the centre. The flight attendants were very sweet all of them barely out of high school. They giggled when they mispronounced words or messed up the announcement. Very cute but wondered who would ever lead whom should an emergency arise. I didn't like my odds. Would not fly Rouge again.,Detractor
" Cape Town to Brisbane via Singapore. This was my first time on Singapore Airlines and the service was outstanding and the cabin crew were superb. The A350 is a wonderful airplane and nearly silent. That was wonderful. The food was delicious, especially given that it is airline food. The cabin was uncrowded and well laid out in business class. The lavatories were spacious, clean and well supplied. I was surprised by no amenity kits and no pajamas in business class on long flights, and the crew did not automatically offer to assist with turning the seat into a bed. The angle at which you could lay flat was on a slant because of where your feet have to go. The cabin music, when playing, is cloying, saccharin and unpleasant. There was free WiFi in business class but I could not get it to work on the SIN-BNE leg and no one on board could solve the problem.",Promoter

Soup was served in a teacup sized bowl main was ok desert was ok too if you like ice cream as that is the only option.

Old business class seat on the Singapore to Istanbul route: this seat type should be removed by Turkish as it is uncompetitive. Had a good sleep though as the space for legs is excellent. Meal quality and quantity great. I was pleased to see that Turkish is testing the dine on-demand concept on the Singapore to Istanbul route. I was told that such a concept will be gradually introduced across all their long-haul flights. Ataturk airport crazy busy as usual - looking forward to the opening of the new airport in October.

" Bologna to Stansted. A truly dreadful experience with Ryanair. Just 15 minutes prior to take off, having checked in etc., flight was cancelled (along with a number of other Ryanair flights) because of heavy rain - funny thing was, every other airline was continuing to fly, there were no other cancellations. There were no Ryanair staff in the airport to help or advise - check-in was being handled by other (I presume airport) staff. So, because of the sudden number of Ryanair cancellations all happening at the same time, that meant there was something like 1000 people all queuing to speak to three, non-Ryanair, staff at the information desk. We managed to book flights on another Ryanair flight, 36 hours (and two expensive nights in a hotel) later.The one good thing? I don't work for Ryanair. I feel truly sorry fo the staff (when you can find them) - they try to be helpful, but they know they work for a bunch of cowboys who couldn't give a damn.

Flew with Norwegian to Lanzarote 30/6/14 - 7/7/14. Can honestly say have never been more impressed with any airline - Norwegian delivered 5 * service with free wifi and comfortable seats. This was my first experience with them and will no doubt be my last. At Gatwick we boarded as soon as the gate was called which meant we left 30 mins early! Coming home we left 20 mins early due to low load. I must say Norwegian are one of the best for delivering quick and quality service. Compared to rival airlines Norwegian really have improved over the years and are becoming big contenders in the aviation market. I was also impressed by the self service check in which made departure quick and easy! Would recommend to anyone considering them.,Promoter

" Riyadh to Athens via Bahrain. The worst airline I've flown. We recently took a flight with our three children from Riyadh to Athens via Bahrain with Gulf Air. The cabin service was pretty unfriendly and just about functional but we didn't have great expectations of Gulf Air - I know they aren't in the same league as Emirates or Qatar. Upon arrival in Athens we experienced that moment every traveller dreads when the baggage carousel finishes spewing out bags, all the other passengers have gone and you are left holding just your hand luggage. We reported it to the Handling Agent in Athens who told us there was another flight arriving that night but for some reason ours couldn't be located and if it was we wouldn't get it for at least another 48 hours. Deep joy. The started of your holiday with three small children and only the clothes you are wearing and a book and half eaten sandwich for company. We then spent the next three days phoning, emailing and tweeting the airline. All to no avail. No response other than a huge phone bill with hours spent waiting on hold. Eventually our bags were delivered 4 days late to a local island but they were damaged and showing signs of mistreatment. Again - no response, apology or communication or any form from the airline. The return journey back to Riyadh was slightly less miserable and we took the opportunity speak to the airline offices in Athens and Bahrain about compensation. No surprises though when the airline said they couldn't / wouldn't help whatsoever - even complimentary lounge access for our 3 children during the 4 hour layover in Bahrain was flatly refused. In all - it's down to customer service or a total lack of, disregard and disdain for their customers and a haphazard operation. I had a similar experience with Emirates in January and by contrast they couldn't have been more helpful. No questions compensation of $250, limo from the airport and they picked up the tab for essential items that I bought whilst they located my bags. Poor show Gulf Air. A really bad service.",Detractor

Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin.

" Seville to Mallorca. The night before our flight, I checked-in online. I tried checking in via the webpage and app but neither seemed to translate to English, so I asked the concierge of the hotel I was staying at to help me check in. I declined to select a seat, pressed â€œnextâ€ and all of a sudden was given the e-ticket. At no point did the app prompt for luggage information (which would have cost 30 euros if checked- in in advance). The next day at the airport, I tried to explain this to the customer service desk, but they told me I had to pay 60 euros â€“ more than the cost of my flight! Further, our flight was delayed by 2 hours: we were supposed to depart at 10:15pm but instead, we only boarded around midnight. Since it was so late at night, the stores were closed and we couldn't buy snacks. Once we got on the plane, we asked for water, but we were informed that all snacks â€“ including water â€“ were for sale only. I have never had an airline charge for water, especially after such a long delay. This was unhumanitarian. In both situations, it seemed like the airline was capitalizing from situations that they created or that were in their control. I wrote to their customer service department explaining this and they still don't seem to get the wrong they have done. I have flown with many airlines around the world â€“ just within this Euro-trip, I had flown with 4 or 5 different airlines, of which 3 of them were discount airlines- and have never gotten such poor treatment.

Even on flights not longer than 40 minutes, they are serving drinks and there is a full service, the only difference being that on a longer flight you would maybe get a sandwich while on a short flight it's crackers.

"  London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. The young stewardess took our orders, then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2 hours before the flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process. I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. This morning I spoke to a member of senior management at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport.

It came with a miserable selection of cheeses in small portions with one meager piece of guava paste. Dessert was something called ""Tiramisu"", nothing like any tiramisu I have ever eaten before. Prior to landing we were served a chicken sandwich which had fused to the dish, if I received something like this at McDonald's, I would refuse it. Once we landed in LAX we engaged in a wheelchair charade that would have been comical if it not been so frustrating. There were 17 wheelchairs at the deplaning area and only four persons to push them. It was a Laurel and Hardy scenario as we see-sawed our way slowly to the Custom's area. Yes, they were not busy on a Saturday evening but it took us an hour to reach them! By the time we were through, the baggage belt had been emptied and all the ambulatory passengers were long gone. Truly a study in inefficiency and a miserable end to what had been up till then a great business trip. My suggestion, change the wheelchair assistance company and get catering from a real food service company.",Passive
" La Guardia to Miami. Upon arrival to the check in desk I was told that I needed to pay 45.00 dollars for each carry on or checked luggage, I ended up paying 90.00 for 2 carry on(mine and my friend's). The lady at the desk had that whatever attitude who does not care if you travel or not and tries to make you feel that she is doing a favor to you checking you while it should be the opposite. I would rate this lade zero. I do not have any bad or good review for the staff at the gate desk, I did not have any interaction longer than 1 minute with them, they were constantly announcing that carry on and check luggage would cost 60.00 dollars now if they were not paid prior at the check in desk. The plane now. All the seats were sold and as a consequence there were not enough overhead compartments for all carry on luggage(which is understandable), but the neither the gate desk staff nor flight attendants informed that issue and failed to propose checking the rest of the carry on, instead they were desperately removing luggage from one compartment to another to make room and secure them all five minutes before taking off. The plane floor was never vacuumed nor the back seat magazines' compartments( not sure if that the right name for it). In my magazine compartment and my friend's I found gum and candy wraps, I cannot really tell if it was the same case for all passengers. My friends suffers of motion disease and was looking for an emergency bag in case of vomiting but no bags were placed in any compartment. I asked the flight attendant to get me one (she was busy accommodating the carry on, but she answered that she will help me soon). Instead getting a real emergency bag I got a grey shopping bag and when I say"" thank you"", she replied ""de nada"" what means you're welcome in Spanish. Perhaps my Cuban look or my Miami accent made her think I needed a reply in Spanish to understand. I found it very disrespectful. In customer service you never switch languages unless the client does it first, plus the right answer was not de nada or you're welcome, it's my pleasure. The flight per se was very smooth. I would like to congratulate the captain. My overall experience with Frontier was bad.",Detractor
Comfortable seats friendly staff and large variety of food and drink. The planes used on North American routes are quite old and no AVOD which means being forced to watch one of 5 movies being played over and over. AVOD is available on the smaller A320s on shorter European routes. The same privileges are not available in economy - seating not that comfortable with little legroom but standard of food is ok. On the plus side they serve some form of snack on the ultra short routes to Beirut and Larnaca which usually don't exceed 50 minutes. Most problems other passengers have faced seem to be with connecting flights on RJ which I cant say I have experienced.,Passive
"The ground staff at Chiang Mai Airport was polite and managed the check in procedure quickly and without any hassles. Boarding the aircraft you were greeted by the flight attendants with a smile, who were helpful and did their job in a polite and professional way. The flight itself was on time and uneventful. Shortly after take off you were served a snack and water. The aircraft was tidy and clean with standard seat configuration (3-3). The seats were a little bit cramped due to a quite narrow seat pitch but for a short flight (about 55 minutes) it was yet sufficient. In fact there was nothing to complain about the flight itself. In my opinion you get value for money as the (mostly reasonable) ticket price is all inclusive. Which means you get a free 20 kg baggage allowance, free seat selection, a free snack and beverage as mentioned above and also don't even get charged extra when paying by credit card. And this is a bliss compared to other so called budget airlines in the region which tend to be very inventive and eager to squeeze the unwary passenger as much as possible by creating various extra fees. Nevertheles near the end of Thai Smile's Internet booking procedure you should check if you really need a travel insurance that seems to be added automatically but can be deselected without problem. But apart from that you are not confronted with extra charges. Last but not least it is also worth mentioning that Thai Smile operates the majority of its flight to/from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport which offers far better transport options onward to the city (and other destinations) than Bangkok Don Muang Airport. If you plan to travel inside Thailand you should consider giving Thai Smile a try.",Passive
"Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied ""oh you said you did not want breakfast"". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without. The flight back to CWL was with Stobart Air packed but no problems. All in all not bad for the price we paid as the outward journey balanced the return.",Passive
"Seat room in economy is tight on the return flight (7 hours 20 mins) our baggage was mistakenly brought to the cargo area instead of baggage claim. We were given no explanation as to why after an hour our bags were still not dispensed. The staff had no idea even where the bags were! After 1 hr 45 mins we were told what happened and that ""we at least know where the bags are"". Exhausted after now a total of 10 hrs a meal voucher was given out when all we wanted was the be on our way! The whole experience was handled very poorly!",Passive
LAX-JFK and return. Never flew United previously so after reading many reviews had lowered my expectations. I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away! Even a pre-boarding offer to check wheelie bags for free due to a full flight was met with disinterest. It really is one area needing tightening up.,Promoter
"The checkin in Munich is awful and you may wait 1 hour. Flight was delayed 30 mins cause of delayed incoming flight, no information from airline. Boarding by bus. Plane was an Embraer 190 (remaining from insolvency of AeroSvit). Legspace okay even for 1.90m person. All drinks and food onboard are for sale, coffee 2EUR like Nescafe, however, sandwich ""Caprese"" for 3EUR surprisingly very tasty. Flight normal, flight information by captain in ""suboptimal"" English, no word about the delay. In Kiev again bus transfer - so, a lot of your flight you will spend in bus.

LHR-HKG (B777) then HKG-PER (A330) and return. Business class. (No First Class on the aircraft I used). Both aircraft's are similar from the point of view of the seat itself and the service you get although the A330 seat is slightly smaller but that is only really noticeable in the smaller side-cupboard by the seat. Storage is impressive and is everywhere. The headphone cabinet has more storage space too and it has a mirror. Seat firm but comfortable. You don't get pyjamas or a mattress with business class with Cathay only in their First Class. Initially I was miffed but actually I didn't notice not having the mattress and I slept well. The amenity kit has ear plugs anyway. Cathay dining is esoteric and not always to a western palate. It is served from a trolley so you get to see the product before you select it which is rather good. Cathay service is practical and competent but I feel that it is not polished like say BA or Emirates. I chose Cathay because I wanted the best seat for a 24 hr flight and in that respect any short-comings in other departments (food no mattress humourless but efficient staff) are insignificant: these seats will get you there in comfort. I was most impressed and will use them again. The seat does it for me - it is what makes a difference after the flight.,Promoter
"I was unhappy with the food. The quality was poor, and for an 11 hour flight there should have been two full meals. There was one meal and three minuscule snacks with water only. On the outward flight the service was excellent, but for the return it was probably the worse I have encountered. I was disappointed and surprised that the Swiss are not always very professional.",Detractor

"  London to Edinburgh return. Check in at T5 quick was able to use the fast track and Galleries North lounge due to frequent flier status, quick security spent an hour in the lounge with good food on offer. Boarding onto a new looking A320 seat 2A with an empty seat next to me, departed 10 min late but otherwise a quick 1 hr flight staffed by a decent crew who served a snack and drink of choice. Landed about 10 minutes late but bags off quickly. Return check in again very quick but security pretty long, used the BA lounge at EDI which is quiet with a few food and drink options, boarded throu gate 11 seat 4F on a pretty old Boeing 767 which was full. Departed on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late, service okay again with a snack and drink offered. Okay experience I use BA domestically and in business clas around Europe because Heathrow is convenient to where I live and to sustain my Executive Club (Oneworld) status, however there are negatives in the fees and credit card booking fee that BA charge which I hate! Additionally I see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for food in economy on Domestic/European flights which puts them budget bracket. I covered 38 flights this year in all classes and while I will continue to use BA in UK/Europe. However this year I've realised there are far cheaper and far better options for long haul within the oneworld alliance.",Passive
We flew between Tehran and Dubai together with my spouse and our 8 month infant. The plane was a Boeing 727-800 with very tight spaces between the seats uncomfortable to hold the baby. I asked for the first row of economy class seats 5A to F but the check in lady in Dubai surprisingly asked for some 150 AED extra charge for each seat which we denied. Furthermore the heat dissipation of the LCD monitors even when they were off was awful the air conditioner couldn't handle it. The last not the least was the baggage allowance for each passenger which is regularly 20 kg and we had to pay about 50$ to buy an extra 20 kg to cover our requirement. Although some airlines like FlyDubai put limitations on their services to provide more economical tickets I guess with using bus to take the passengers to the plane or eliminating catering FlyDubai couldn't deduct the price in the competition market to give appealing offers. Considering the above points I will try not to employ their services again particularly when the baby is involved.,Detractor
We recently traveled from the US to Ireland. When we called in on seat assignments for the flight over we paid an extra $60 per person for seats that were to have more room (Rows 9-12) so we could sleep better. Turns out that the seats we had on the way home had more leg room and reclined further so that was wasted money. On the way home the entertainment recycled twice so there was a while where you couldn't watch a movie and since we were in the middle of one when it went down had to adjust it to get back to the spot where it crashed.,Passive
"When I went to check in for this flight (which connected in New York with an Air France Flight to Paris) the Delta check in people in Rochester told me that they needed my visa information to check in. I didn't have a visa, as I am getting it while I am in Europe. This seems like an oversight on the airline's part, but the people managed to get me checked in with another system. While on the flight, we were informed that since it was a short flight, no drinks would be served in economy (which was annoying). Other than that the aircraft was clean and we arrived in New York on time. The wifi on the flight did not work well enough for me to use the Delta app or Delta Studio.",Passive
" Larnaca to Budapest. This is the first time I booked a flight with Wizzair due to its ""low fares"", as I was going fro a very short stay trip. We have been charged additional 35 euros per passenger, at the airport because we didn't check in online. When you book the ticket (and I have booked so many times flight tickets with different companies), there is not any message saying that the self check in online is mandatory. The way of wording for the online check in, is similar to the rest companies as usual saying that :the online check is available two or some days before the flight and if you like you can check in online by yourself to avoid the waiting time at the airport, but nowhere is clearly stating that you must check in by yourself. This is too obvious, that the company is just trying to find ways to earn additional money. It would be way better, to just increase your fares and include the implicit services within the fare. This is the most ridiculous charge I have ever paid to an air company. Other than that, we have been advised that our cabin luggage couldn't been carried onboard the plane to the normal cabin storage place, because we didn't book our ticket with priority boarding and there should be an extra charge if we wanted to take our luggage with us. We have added two 10kg cabin bags along with our tickets, but we couldn't carry them with us because we didn't have priority boarding! Seriously? These unjustifiable charges, in total cost us EUR 94.00 additional to our tickets. Unacceptable.",Detractor
"  San Francisco to Frankfurt in First Class. Lufthansa uses the United Global First Lounge at SFO, a pleasant, but unremarkable, space. Lufthansa's A380 First Class cabin has an 8-seat arrangement. I was in 1A, right in the front and on the second deck of the aircraft. Upon entry into the cabin each First Class passenger is given a personal locker to store carry-on luggage. The seat was extremely comfortable, with a modicum of privacy provided by an adjustable screen separator. Two spacious washrooms serviced the First Class cabin. Where Lufthansa's First Class product excelled was in its exceptional onboard service. The lady flight attendant assigned to me was highly professional and personable, anticipating my needs as the flight progressed. Turndown service with mattress and blanket was provided when I wanted to sleep. Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages there's nothing to add to on that front. As for the food, this is as good as it gets on a flight, but I like to eat light. After landing, I went to the excellent Lufthansa First Class Lounge at FRA, an oasis of calm, and after a relaxing couple of hours was driven in a limousine via the tarmac directly to my outbound aircraft.",Promoter
Flew from Auckland to Vancouver. It was a tired old plane and the movie selection was pretty tired also. Food was ok but a second cup of tea was hard to obtain. The cabin was clean.

The airport is impressive compared to the old one but there is a design flaw which is letting too much light so at day time it is very hot inside.

YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase. AC offers an expensive inconsistent product with unreliable on time performance.,Passive
"Flew Qantas Airways from Melbourne to Hong Kong, we never expect that much with Qantas but this was flight was an all time low. When we travel economy we choose to sit at the back of the plane as we prefer the two by two configuration. The downside to this is your are served your meal last. This was not an issue, what was an issue was having the option of cold chicken salad, or cold chicken salad, as the other two options had run out. The improvements to Qantas's food was evident through the new menu options and size of everyone's meals, yet this was somewhat irrelevant to us as we ate nothing as we were unable to order what we wanted from the menu nor have any choice whatsoever (not wanting a 'cold' chicken salad). I realize this all sounds petty, but when you are traveling eight hours or so, you expect a 'hot' meal and a 'choice' of which hot meal, especially considering these meals cost the airline $2-$4 per passenger. Compare this to our Emirates flight from HK to Dubai where breakfast was fresh fruit, danish, tea/coffee, and warm croissants that we're offered throughout the meal time. In addition, the airplane interior was terribly dated, terribly dirty with the entertainment system at least 10 years old and 1/2 the size of Emirates entertainment systems. We really try to support our national carrier choosing this flight above other 'cheaper' flights (Royal Brunei, Malaysian, Air India) but they do make it hard to do. As Qantas have and continue to 'outsource' many jobs overseas I think we'll just give up on Qantas from now on as they have given up on so many of their loyal workforce.",Detractor

"London to Dubai A380. This was my first time on Qantas in many years as last time I flew them I felt they were very poor but have read how much they have invested in improving the product so wanted to try again. This was the first leg of a multi-leg journey in combination with partner airline Emirates which made for an interesting comparison. A380 although relatively new was starting to look tired inside. Dark carpets and dull seat colours made for a very dark gloomy interior. Seat comfortable but legroom surprisingly tight especially considering the long flying times Qantas international flights make. Inflight entertainment good sized touch screen tv screens with very good selection of movies TV music and games. Inflight entertainment on from gate to gate which is a great touch. Crew predominantly British friendly and professional. ""Supper"" service served from London to Dubai which essentially consisted of choice of hot main meal and small desert. Tasty meal but for an evening service where dinner would normally be served very limited. A tiny carrot muffin and juice served just before landing. Qantas are obviously cost cutting evident through their reduced meal service adding more rows into economy by removing a number of toilets at the rear of the A380 and lack of legroom. It was not a bad service or product but it could be so much better especially in line with what their partner Emirates offer.",Passive

"  This flight from Bodhgaya to Delhi was the latest of about 20 domestic flights sectors completed with Air India over the last 3 - 4 years. The level of service has remained consistent in all areas, with some aspects of service stronger than others. This flight was originally due to depart Bodhgaya at 14.35h arriving in Delhi at 16.25h. An initial delay to a revised 16.00h departure was notified by e-mail several hours in advance. Check-in queue management at Bodhgaya airport was poor but agent service was good once you eventually got to the check-in desk. After further delay at Bodhgaya airport the flight eventually departed shortly after 18.00h and arrived at Delhi at about 20.00h. Not a single delay announcement was made at Bodhgaya airport and the information board simply showed the word 'delay' next to the flight number. We had no idea how long the delay would be until we saw our aircraft land. Except for an expensive coffee kiosk there were no customer facilities while waiting. The flight itself was straightforward and typical of one on Air India's short-haul A320 fleet with friendly, patient, efficient cabin crew and reasonably comfortable seating in a slightly grubby cabin. A simple in-flight snack was served. No announcements from the captain except an abrupt order for cabin crew to take their seats for take off and again for landing. Cabin crew announcements included a sincere apology for the delay. Arrived at Delhi's Terminal 3 where we exited through the international arrivals section because our flight had originated in Yangon, Burma, before picking up passengers in Bodhgaya. This meant that the domestic passengers among us had to join a long slow-moving queue to clear, bizarrely, passport control, where just two desks were dedicated to clearing many domestic passengers, presumably from several flights. It took more than an hour just to get as far as the baggage hall. The lesson is to remember to leave plenty of time if you take a domestic flight with Air India before connecting to an international flight.",Passive

"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.",Passive
Flew Rouge Toronto to Phoenix 2 days ago. Knew it would be tight but they could put more padding on their seats. After a 5hour flight back was extremely sore.

My husband had no room on his fold down tray. And when we asked for it to he taken attendant refused. To top everything off because things were so tight we accidentally left our passport holder on the plane and didn't realize until next day. Fortunately got passports back but money was stolen.

Nowhere in the booking process was there any warning that ""Rouge"" is essentially AC's version of Air Transat at AC prices: they've ripped out all the seats with entertainment systems and replaced them with pre-1970 style seats decreased the seat spacing and if you want a beer or glass of wine you have to pay through the nose. It would have been nice to have some indication of this in advance! On top of that the service was slow and terrible. Whoever in AC management thought that creating something as sub-par as Rouge was a wise business decision needs to have their head examined. This will do irreparable damage to AC's already sliding reputation.",Detractor
" Hong Kong to Los Angeles. The flight was amazing, although there were one or two bad parts about the experience. Unfortunately, the experience started off terribly. We were faced with an unfriendly check-in staff member. There were additional security checks in place for flights to the US, and they were quick and smooth. Boarding was smooth. Premium Economy cabin for this flight was only 1/3 full. We were able to move around easily. The flight attendants were extremely nice, friendly and approachable and provided excellent service. IFE has plenty of movies to watch. The meal was delicious. We arrived in Los Angeles on time, but my mother had accidentally left her iPad on the seat. One of the crew members ran in and got it out for her quickly.",Promoter
ADL-LHR via HKG. Check-in at ADL quick and easy well organised. Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through. Cathay Pacific you need to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.,Passive

AI 112 LHR-DEL. Check-in fast at a very crowded and pushy LHR Terminal 4 pre-Christmas. Plane left punctually. Crew polite but a little surly but put that down to just the 'Indian way'. Comfy big seats in Executive Class and 100% flat beds in 777-300. The cabin was quiet throughout the duration of the flight. Magazines only offered to first cabin? Crew could not work out my gluten free meal and kept having to replace my tray after serving. Cabin was too hot during shut-eye time and no waters handed out before sleeping. Amenities kit just socks and an eye mask however asked crew for toothbrush/paste which they supplied immediately and then left a pile in the toilets.

" Berlin to Athens. I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I feel it necessary to warn people about Ryanair. I tried to check in online before my flight, but neither their app or their website were working. I figured, â€œNo worries. I'll just check in at the airport. I don't even have any bags to checkâ€. But when I got to the ticket counter I was informed that because I did not check in online I would be charged a 55 Euro â€œcheck in feeâ€. I was at the ticket counter an hour and a half before my flight, but they told me you could only check in in person 2 hours before a flight to avoid the 55 Euro fee? I've never heard of any other airline doing something like this. I asked if I had any other options since I had tried to check in via their app and website which had not been working. I was rudely told â€œPay the fee now, or get out of line and don't fly with us.â€ To top it all off, the exchange rate to US dollars made my fee increase to $61.52. They also charged the two people I was traveling with, so in total we paid $184.56 for a â€œcheck in feeâ€. Ryanair must make a fortune doing this to people. Don't let them do this to you!

A fantastic service and I would be delighted to travel with Finnair to Helsinki and beyond. A special mention to the crew who had a good few years of experience under their belt, extremely professional and courteous throughout.

" Brisbane to Tokyo via Sydney. Here is an outline of events. Our flight from Brisbane on the 20th of December 2019 was delayed due to bad weather in Sydney. We were then kept in a holding pattern above Sydney for an hour or so, only to arrive in Sydney with a short time to get to our connecting gate. We were madly rushing to get to the new gate, only to find out that the gate had changed (which we weren't notified of) and had also been delayed while they waiting for passengers being diverted from another flight. Now waiting for another couple of hours in the Sydney airport, we are finally told that the plane has engineering problems. After another half an hour of waiting we are told that the flight is cancelled because either the problem was not fixed or they couldn't take off, as it was too late. My family and I then waited to find out what was happening next. After they had seen to all the local Sydney residents, we were next told that we were being put up in a hotel. When we arrived at the apartment, we were told that they couldn't check us in because the Qantas credit card had been declined. At this time it was after 1am in the morning and we had been travelling for 8-9 hours. As a 6 person family, I was surprised they put us in an apartment that slept 4 people. Two of my children had to sleep on the floor. The hotel was not able to supply any roll out beds. We were also told that we had a $50 to spend per person, however when we arrived at the unit, there was clearly no where to get any food. So I had to go for a walk to find a Nightowl convenience store to find some food for the children. Likewise in the morning there was nowhere to find breakfast so I had to go out and find somewhere, being unable to use the credit vouchers I was told we had. During this time we had received no communication updates from Qantas with regards to our flight that had been rescheduled. When we arrived at the airport, I approached a Qantas person to check in our luggage. They directed me to another location, which we all followed. Upon arriving there, (I believe it was the standby counter) we were told that this was not the place and directed to another place. When we arrived there, we got in a queue to check in our luggage. About 15 min into the queue, a Qantas supervisor started coming over to us, yelling and shouting at us in an extremely unprofessional and disgusting way, telling us we were in the wrong place and that this counter was shutting. To which we informed her, that we had been directed by another Qantas staff member to come here. Eventually she allowed us to stay. However 10 min later, another family was coming over, which infuriated the Qantas supervisor even more, and again another shouting session occurred. She continued to complain loudly enough for everyone to hear, how bad it was that people were coming over. The other group was actually being accompanied by another Qantas staff member. So vicious was the shouting and exchange it brought the other Qantas staff member to tears, which made all of us and our family extremely uncomfortable. After a good deal more waiting we finally were at the stage of checking in our luggage. Only to be informed that they could check us in, but we needed to take our luggage somewhere else â€“ to the oversized baggage section as the conveyor belt operators had left and it was no longer being used. The whole experience has left a terrible taste in our mouths, and a disgusting response from Qantas in regards to reparations",Detractor
"  Having flown with AirBaltic over the past 10 years, and only had one bad flight on the Gatwick to Riga route. This return flight was well above the high standard of the service that the airline operates, however they are let down by the Ground Handling agents at LGW (Gatwick Ground Handling). The boarding of the flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to ground staff leaving a set of doors open on the next gate (33) and a BA 777 been parked on that stand. Hence passengers arriving disembarked via the walk way across gate 32. Which according to the cabin crew is a daily occurrence since the terminal changes at Gatwick, hence we departed 30 minutes late but were able to make up 25 minutes due to the tail wind. Pre ordered meal was good value for money and tasty. The cabin service was slick. The announcements from the cockpit and cabin were clear and informative. The prices onboard were high street prices and good value. The outbound trip was on a half empty plane and the return the plane again was only about 75% full. The return flight I was offered an upgrade at the airport on check in the day before and the service at the Customer Service Desk was excellent. This is the first time I have flown Airbaltic in Business class and was surprised at the level of service offered. Again the food was tasty. Arrival at both airports the formalities were fast and quick I took 15 minutes at Riga and 20 minutes at Gatwick. Due to the problems with the ground service at Gatwick on the outbound flight, I have adjusted the score of Airport Service. However I am due to fly again with the airline on the same route in June and today have received an email telling me that the flight time have been adjusted by 30 minutes.",Promoter

The aircraft (with the exception of NZ 135 seriously needs refurbishing the seats were hard and very cramped for long haul travel the IFE was terrible the picture quality was poor to say the least and because there are no inflight magazines it took some time and patience to navigate. As experienced travellers one could only say that the food was as bad as it gets and if you want water after meal service you have to go look for someone to serve you. It would be nice if Air NZ would get into the current technology century and provide USB chargers in every seat not just in Business Class as were informed mid fight.

" Houston to San Francisco. I had an absolutely horrible experience with United (as I almost always do), but this time will never use them again.

They eventually cancelled my flight due to said weather at 10:45 pm (another United flight to SF at 11 pm that night took off without delays so I know it wasn't weather). Then I had to get in line for an agent to rebook, which was >100 people long. In the hour I waited, I called United and was placed on a â€œ5-10 minute holdâ€ that was actually >30 minutes, only to tel me there's nothing they can do. When I got to the agent finally, around midnight, he rebooked me for an AM flight and gave me a 35% discount to nearby hotels but no free stay since the cancellation was â€œout of their control.â€ He promised me that if I payed for the hotel however, that United would reimburse me no questions asked. I confirmed this several times and he literally promised me this is the case. I payed $100 for the nearest hotel and spent the night. I filed the complaint to get my money back and they replied 5 days later with a short email saying they will not reimburse me anything but hope I can overloo this and continue to use their airline...

No lumbar support in seat. Middle row had to ask to have reading lights turned off for whole section on return (red eye) flight so they could sleep. Food on flight over acceptable breakfast meal on return flight edible. The only 2 good things I can say about the complementary IPads are: didn't have to pay for it in Premium Rouge and I finally learned how to play Angry Birds because the movie selection was ""thin"". Staff were ""preppy"" and helpful but they must be exhausted by having to constantly apologize ""we're working on it"" when customers complain.

"  Bangkok to Seoul. I have flown Thai Airways numerous times over the last 4 years. They have had nothing but my respect for the quality of service provided, friendliness and excellent flying experience. On this past trip I flew with them from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and then Chiang Mai to Bangkok and on to Seoul. On August 26 the flight was delayed leaving Chiang Mai by 10 minutes. The connection time in Bangkok was only scheduled to be 1 hour which made the connection tight and tighter with the delay. Upon arriving in Bangkok there was a line up for transit security however it moved along fairly well. Because of the delay I boarded with everyone else and that was no a problem for me. As I was seated one of the flight attendants was clearly not amused or friendly that I had not been seated before. That Thai friendliness and welcome was not there. A few minutes later as we were taxing for take off the youngest of the flight attendants in business aggressively and rudely barged in to the space in front of my seat and grabbed pillows and rudely announced that they were going in the overhead bin. I have never experienced such rudeness from one of the Thai flight attendants before. This same flight attendant repeated her performance prior to landing in Seoul. I coupled that with the lack of welcome and friendliness upon being seated and it was not the greatest of experiences with Thai this time on that flight. If they were not pleased with the tight connection and my inability to be earlier to my seat, then they should take that up with their airline and not blame me. As for the other flight attendant with the rudeness, she needs to be more familiar with appropriate etiquette. The quality of food, cleanliness of the aircraft were of the same very high quality that I have come to know and appreciate with Thai.

However snacks (except for one tiny bag of pretzels) and meals were only available for purchase at high prices.

Additionally, in flight entertainment was not free, but my monitor was not working anyways. Finally, seat comfort is not great.

" Budapest to Luton. While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free. The pilot gave detailed information on the route and weather.

"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines â€“ starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips â€“ first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn't a big surprise â€“ despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time â€“ on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul â€“ one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation â€“ and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members â€“ first to a supervisor in the check in area â€“ who said â€œnoâ€ and that was that. At the care Point â€“ the staff couldn't care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there's an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise â€“ Europe's Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service â€“ caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Detractor

"  I just recently flew on Spirit for the first time from FLL to LGA for a weekend trip to New York City. Prior to my flight, I had read some pretty nightmare-ish reviews on this airline and was not going in with any expectations whatsoever. Unsurprisingly, my entire experience with Spirit was not a very pleasant one and was in line with other people's negative reviews of their Spirit trips. Firstly, the low ticket prices, while alluring on the surface, are a complete hoax as Spirit nickels and dimes you for every little part of your trip beyond the cheap ticket price. To start, in the year 2017 there is no option for a mobile ticket. You either have to print the ticket at home or once you get to the airport at check in for an extra $10 or so. Believe me, you will want to choose your seat previous to arriving at the airport or else you have to stand by the check in desk at the gate and wait for a miserable/unhelpful attendant to shout out your name for your seating assignment, basically an almost inevitable middle seat towards the back of the plane. So with that factoring in, you are already adding another $30 or so to your ticket price. You get charged ridiculous fees for checked or carry on bags at the airport so make sure to pay for those in advance through the website (try at all costs to avoid having to call the customer service line unless you want to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to speak to yet another miserable Spirit employee whose anything but eager to help you solve your issue). Yes, you have to pay for any carry on greater than the size of a small backpack. Also keep in mind the maximum weight for checked bags is a mere 40 pounds, compared to the industry standard 50 with every other airline, ridiculous I know. The flight, after being delayed 3 hours for ""weather"" despite the forecasts for both Florida and New York being beautiful and clear, was not terrible. The seat was not the most comfortable but it was not the most uncomfortable either. There were no outlets or entertainment screens, again expecting the worse I was not surprised with this. The flight attendant crew was friendly and accommodating but again you have to pay for everything on board, including $3 for a glass of water. Much better off bringing your own snacks on board. Needless to say, I booked my return flight home with another airline for the same price as it ended up costing me for my flight with Spirit but with outlets, entertainment screens, on board snacks included and no ridiculous seat, bag, or ticket fees. Do not fall victim to Spirit's falsely ""bargain"" flights unless you want to arrive late with a mountain of frustration and a dead phone.",Detractor
" Washington to Salt Lake City via Denver. Worst airline ever. This was the first and last time I will fly with Frontier. When we had arrived at our destination they had lost our car seat and told us we never checked one. Then they didn't have a temporary one for us to use which left us stuck in the airport until a store was open for us to buy one until they figured out where ours was. All customer service reps we talked to were rude, unhelpful, and combative. I can imagine that it is due to the fact that frontier doesn't care about its customers. The greatest service they could provide us all is to shutdown their business. I am only rating them 1/10 because I can't give them less.",Detractor
"  Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. One cannot complain about the service on Etihad Airways as there is none to complain about. This last trip to Abu Dhabi was without doubt the worst. Settled in, had a drink while waiting to take off and gave the chef my meal order. 2 hours from landing and a 13 hour flight, no food, no drinks and even my potato chips were removed from my cabin! I was offered no bedding, and only had a neck cushion and rug which became unbearable. Asked where my meal was and told that nothing could be served as the chef was on his break - thought it was dining on demand? I couldn't have breakfast because I didn't order any! Went to economy looking for food, but it was full. Found a seat at the back of business and sat there for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. I was at least given a pillow and a blanket! Was offered a steak sandwich 1/2 an hour before landing and that was all I got all trip. When I arrived at Abu Dhabi airport, I went to the lounge and refused to leave until management addressed my concerns. After about an hour and a half a manager came and promised me the world of empty promises! Asked my travel agent to book the return flight in Business as First was so bad, only to be told it would cost me $2,000 to downgrade. Email after email was getting me no where, so went on facebook, and Etihad then blocked me and removed my posts.",Detractor
"Ethiopian Airlines has the worst Business Class experience. Old plane, with no personal TV screens, and of the two very small screens at front the plane, one was constantly flickering and the other was black and white. In addition the outlet for the headphones was not connecting properly so sounds was far from clear. Then the choice to play a subtitled Chinese movie was also an odd choice and hardly a new release, if one was able to see or hear the movie. As I went to charge my iphone was told that the power outlet at the seat was not working, then apparently there was not power at any seat. Food was unappetising. Although the staff were pleasant they were far from concerned about the lack of amenities or service in Business Class, and not able to offer any solutions, apart from more overheated food when the first dish was too terrible to consume. A definite no fly option if you want amenities and service in an airline.",Detractor
"  Sydney to Christchurch. I do not understand why Air New Zealand often gets glowing reviews. It is an okay airline but nothing more. Budget airlines in Asia such as Cebu Pacific and Air Asia provide a similar service, and Air NZ is definitely not a budget airline when one has to buy a ticket at the last minute for the relatively short trip over the Tasman sea. There was very little leg room on the plane. My flight was okay, nothing more.

Good service by friendly staff and tasty meals, both Western and Chinese options, with regular offers of wine and spirits throughout the trip.

Athens to Roma in Economy. Boarding was good but it turned rather bad once on-board. A women who decided that she wanted a window seat even though she did not have one just sat in one. This than created all kinds of drama. The mans seat who's this was asked her to move and she refused. He called a flight attendant and even she could not get her to move. She was glued to that seat and that was that. So the man had to move seats but he was with his wife and they wanted to seat together so all up 3 rows were shuffled to accommodate this women who wanted a window seat. Why the flight attendant just didn't move the original offender is beyond me. Once underway all was good. Short flight so no entertainment and a simple drink and nuts. Luggage was out quick in Roma.,Passive
SFO-LAS short flight on a 737 - flight departed about 25mins late arrived a bit late seats comfortable for a short flight. The flight did what it said on the tin. However in my years of flying I've seen nothing like it! Onboard no crew at the door sat down and noticed people across from me put three large bags by their feet and then put tray tables down to cover them. Crew failed to spot this on a few occasions but eventually did ask 'can you put your tray table up' walked away before they seeing the bags. Crew served drinks by just looking at you no thank you no hello nothing! The flight had a free gift of cards given out - thrown at you of course. On leaving the flight the crew were at the front chatting. First time I've flown United is the last based on crew attitude - no smile no communication.,Detractor

Everything expected of Thai is delivered, good service and good catering on board for this 2 hour flight. We experienced a slight delay due to some no shows and had to off load their luggage. Everything went smoothly once we took off. I must say cost cutting is really obvious with their catering, with much smaller serving and all courses onto one tray.

"  Milan to San Francisco via Frankfurt. Truly first class experience and quality of highest level. The connection flight from Milan was good, efficient, but delayed by 30 minutes (because of security issues in Frankfurt). Cabin crew assured me that the connection in Frankfurt with 1 hour would be guaranteed. In Frankfurt the Lufthansa first class treatment took off. At the remote parking a Mercedes Limo was waiting to drive me to the First Lounge. Then the Transfer to the A380 was done in a Cayenne Porsche, the staff took my luggage and guided me with special lift and passage directly to the first class cabin of A380. And all with no fuss, no problem attitude by friendly drivers. The First cabin is open designed with enough privacy, very comfortable seats and again highly motivated, efficient and friendly staff.

" Have largely positive things to say from London Heathrow - Bahrain - Chennai return trip over Christmas. All flights were roughly on time and very comfortable overall. Seats on both legs were fine and it should be noted that the A321 has an extra inch or so of legroom and better padding over the A330. Service from FAs was fine, with most of them making an effort to fulfil passengers' requests, serving a meal and a small snack on both flights of decent quality- I found myself finishing them all so they must have been ok and the offering was different on all 4 flights so good variety. Selection of drinks was small, basically just offering 2 juices and 2 soft drinks (some of which ran out in flight). Seat back entertainment was only average - the screens themselves were good quality but selections of movies, tv shows and music was small (probably around 10 western films available). Bahrain airport is small though largely clean and easy to navigate, with a small number of dining options and a fair amount of seating (none of which enables you to lie down if you have a long layover) so it was fine overall, as long as you don't mind folk washing their feet in the sink in the toilets, which seemed common! We were fortunate in that both legs between Bahrain and Chennai were far from full so once boarding was complete we managed to grab a whole row of 3 seats each to ourselves, meaning we had plenty of space to lie down in flight, though it's worth noting that none of the armrests on the A321 raise fully so you have to push them up half way and contort your body to fit. My impression of Gulf was that they'll do the job mostly well, though with no frills at all and every so often cracks appearing in the quality e.g. tissue holders coming loose in bathrooms and FAs slow to replace empty loo rolls and most worryingly on 2 flights when passengers stood up as soon as we'd landed but still taxiing and they started opening luggage compartments and moving down the aisle, FAs did practically nothing to stop them! On arrival at Heathrow we taxied for approx 10 mins with 30-40 people standing in the aisles, luggage compartments open, the plane braking heavily several times and the FAs simply asked a couple of people very quietly to sit down, when they didn't, the response was to give up! I would fly with them again if the price were right again, my wife and I paid Â£440 &, Â£650 respectively for flights at slightly different times around Christmas and overall this saved us several hundred pounds over other airlines.",Promoter
"  Newark to Dresden via Dusseldorf. I would not recommend Lufthansa, staff are not professional and lack customer service. I am a 24-year-old female from New York, and I traveled by myself for the first time for a friend's wedding. It was a terrible and exhausting trip. I missed my connecting flight and had an additional 6 hours of travel by train. Trying to get the train itself was a nightmare. I waited on four different lines in which staff refused to help me, and treated me without courtesy because I could not speak the language. I finally had to get help from a stranger from Dusseldorf who could properly convey what I needed. They lost my luggage, and it was not recovered for four days, a day after the wedding. I had to go to the airport to recover it and was told my lost baggage claim didn't exist and I was blamed for it being mishandled, and when I showed the staff that I had done it properly, they did not apologize to me, they just handed me a feedback card.

"You get what you pay for with Wow Air. Booking is pretty easy online. I was surprised when asked to choose my seat and that charges were added to my bill based on where I sat. I chose to sit in the cheap seats $5-$10 on each leg. When I boarded I really didn't see a whole lot of difference between my seat and the more expensive ones up front though there may have been a couple of inches difference. The plane was clean and the staff friendly. I didn't mind that there was no entertainment. I brought a good book and read or napped the whole way. I had chosen aisle seats but still felt claustrophobic when the passenger in front of me moved his seat back. It's tight! I had read that food was extra and expensive (they even charge for water) so I picked up something at Logan airport on the flight over to Denmark. The problem on the return to Boston was that I had barely 40 minutes between flights once I got off the plane in Reykjavik. I couldn't spend much time making selections or using the lady's room (fortunately only a short line). And it was a 15-20 minute walk to my gate in Iceland. Speaking of Iceland, the only flight from Boston to Copenhagen is overnight and also stops in Iceland at 4am. This layover, unlike the return, is 3 hours long and the entire airport is closed and practically deserted. Even my gate wasn't open. If any airline is going to drop off people in the middle of the night the airport should have something open-or better, cots set up so we can sleep. It's a long time at an awful hour to be sitting and waiting. Being able to have breakfast would be nice. My only big complaint on this trip was that Wow Air doesn't have a desk set up in Copenhagen airport until 2 hours before the flight. You cannot get a boarding pass online but must go to the gate. The line queues up fast and it's long as the flight is full. And here's the problem-having been in the EU for 2 weeks I wanted to get a tax refund. The system is already complicated and designed to discourage this. But since you need a boarding pass to get the customs stamp I had to wait for Wow Air to open a desk. Once you get your boarding pass you also give them your checked luggage. Customs want to see what you have bought, not just receipts, so be sure to have it all in your carry on luggage. People who get boarding passes ahead don't have this issue as they are still in possession of their checked luggage. Once you have the customs stamp you then have to find the correct bank/agency for the refund. There are several. All this takes time and waiting in line and then you still have to clear security. So I barely made my flight out of Copenhagen. It's stressful and shouldn't be. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight hoping to take care of all of this.",Passive

One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect.

Traveled with Aer lingus in May 2013 from London to Belfast City. Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough.

" Chicago to Vienna on their Boeing 767, with a very nice interior and a great entertainment system. Austrian's impeccably trained and very well-groomed cabin crew were at the top of their game both times. I also had a great experience with kind airport agents. My first issue - seat selection for a booking made via United was not available on Austrian's website for the segments of my itinerary they operated. I was assigned random seats when I checked in. Lufthansa on the other hand allow seat selection on their website for segments they operate, even when you book via United. My second issue was food. You'd expect that on a 9 hour overnight flight they'd pamper you more in terms of food (beverage service is pretty varied, but I care more about food service. On the long-haul flight for dinner they have a choice of two dishes with a limited amount of servings available, so that when one is gone, you are stuck with the other. The assumption that everyone will automatically accept what is left has proven wrong in my case, because for personal reasons, I didn't want the pasta with that was left, but the dish that was gone (chicken). As they couldn't accommodate my request, I asked if they had any snacks for purchase. They first misunderstood me and gave me 3 more bags of some salty crackers that they had served as a starter. I was told the only thing they had for purchase was chocolate (I assume as a part of their duty-free offer). It turned out my only option was to eat the dish that they had left, buy chocolate or stay hungry. Before landing we were served a muffin for breakfast. I personally do not like having sweets as a meal.",Passive
"I use Sunwing because it is cheap to certain spots so I'm not going to complain about seating or extra charges to pick seats etc they do have the best price on a lot of tours.

Head stewardess just glared back and moved on. On the way back an elderly/not so fit women had a window seat she decided to sit in the aisle seat when the person who owned that seat showed up she didn't want to move the steward had to make her move to her assigned window seat.

NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways. As a result we came to SGN 40 minutes late so I lost my onward connection and had to purchase new ticket from VN-airlines.,Promoter
" Today's flight was 100% booked which was to be expected since our flight was on the first Sunday of the Dutch School holidays. Through the Dutch media we were warned that Amsterdam Schiphol airport should be overcrowded. Through the KLM website we received the advise to arrive at the airport 3hrs before departure. Since we can use the Skypriortity fast track services at this airport we took our chance and arrived 2 1/2hrs before flight and slipped through luggage drop-off and security in less than 15 minutes! Boarding was efficient and on time, on board we were welcomed by the crew who had the time for a chit-chat with all passengers while boarding. The flight departed and arrived well on time. The onboard service consisted of a warm sandwich and a drink followed by a 2nd round when muffins were distributed. We had exit seats (pre-booked) which are the best seats on the plane with tons of legroom. Disembarkation in Lisbon was OK but we had to wait over 30minutes for our luggage to arrive on the belt. However our golf bags who arrived on a separate belt for special luggage were delivered promptly.",Passive
San Francisco to Calgary via Seattle. Really awful service from start to finish. I booked my flight through Westjet so Delta is refusing to do anything about it despite the lady at the help desk saying they would. Agent gave me boarding pass to different flight without telling me mine had been cancelled. This flight was delayed and we were not communicated with whatsoever causing many of us to miss our connections. Staff were stressed and rude. Told us we could try running. Connection left 3 minutes before departure even though there were five of us running to get there. New flight landed at midnight meaning either sleep in the airport or try to get picked up then which was not possible for many of us. Refused to get us hotel since we couldn't get picked up. Told us to complain and we would receive some kind of compensation which is now not happening either. Absolutely nothing was done to help us out during the experience. We were never communicated with and had to ask repeatedly to find out what was going on. I was promised they'd fix it and they refuse to do anything to make up for it.,Detractor

After such a long day flying from Santorini to Athens, then Athens to Doha, I have boarded this QR832 to Bangkok and I received a very warm welcome from the flight attendant in upper deck section where I had my seat (30A). After she learned that I have had a few connections beforehand and I was very tired, she has done everything in her power to make my flight the most comfortable.

"  Flew American Airlines from San Diego to Dallas Fort Worth in F on an Airbus 321 (with US Airways livery). Web Check-in worked fine and bag drop at a manned premium counter as I flew F, but in Y everything is do it yourself, except for weighing of the bags. TSA friendly and fast with short lines. SAN seemed to be an easy and well managed airport. No Admirals Club at SAN. Boarding orderly and uneventful. Cabin Crew professional and not necessarily unfriendly, but even in F rather short and devoid of any charm and warmth. No IFE on board, but WIFI was supposedly available for a fee. Lunch served was either a salad with salmon (edible, but not great) or quinoa with vegetables and cheese (cheap choices and definitely not in line with expectations for a flight of 4 hours in F or C). Seats were standard domestic First recliner seats and comfortable enough for a 4 hour daytime flight. Flight departed and arrived on time, which was good. Rather average for a U.S. domestic flight, but below average in most other markets, a painless experience with no particular highlights other than an on-time arrival.

Flight EK148 AMS-DXB on 7/2/2015 in business class. Boarding in AMS was a joke. The economy class pax blocked the way to the gate exit to the aircraft. The ground staff did nothing here when boarding for the first and business class passengers began. Chaos was the word that came to my mind. About 20 minutes delay on departure. Food was of poor quality. The inflight service no better than any other 4-star airline. The seats are acceptable and provide ample space. We were transported by bus to the terminal upon arrival in Dubai. This took about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes walk to the to the train for transport to the next terminal and another 15 minutes to get to the lounge. What happened to their so-called famous A380 terminal where all A380 aircraft can be handeld. Lounge was OK. Flight EK384 DXB-BKK on 8/2/2015 in business class. No exciting flight. What you can expected for the price you paid for business class. Food was mediocre. FA were friendly and gave good service. Flight EK385 BKK-DXB on 19/2/2015. Again an uneventful flight with food less than mediocre. FA's acceptable. Flight EK147 DXB-AMS. The best of the four legs. FA omnipresent and very friendly. Food was good.

"Emirates has a super F-class product. The driver takes you from home to the airport. Check in easy and efficient and you can go to the Emirates lounge in Manchester and a superb one in Dubai. The lounge in Cape town has a fantastic shower but lounge is overcrowded sadly. A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent. Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised! The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful. The Boeing 777 from Dubai to Cape Town is a less glamorous aircraft but the service and comfort was top notch.

The food was edible and we had pork with noodles going and chicken stir fried rice for main meals. There were snacks and non alcoholic drinks available whenever you wanted them although more hot drinks would have been nice. The inflight entertainment was excellent with a choice of games and recent blockbuster films. The children were very happy and kept occupied. Most importantly it was a direct flight EVA being one of a handful of airlines including Thai airways and BA who fly direct between the UK and Thailand saving a minimum of 2-3 hours on the journey time.

However, the customer service wasn't very good. The flight attendants came across as cold and the plane was obviously understaffed (especially the SVO to PVG leg) and therefore it took the lone flight attendant forever to hand out meals and collect trays afterwards. The inflight entertainment had rather limited choices and there were no snacks available throughout the flight in the galley - only drinks. There were also fewer lavatories on Aeroflot's B777 compared to some other airlines. The layover in SVO wasn't pleasant at all. There were only a handful of seats near the departure gate and no free WiFi connection that would be actually working with my or my partner's smartphone. The corridors there are pretty narrow and crowded. Thankfully my layover was short. Overall, it was alright given the very low price, I suppose, but I will probably avoid flying with Aeroflot for some time - the few bucks that I saved weren't worth the discomfort.",Passive
"Flew out on the 21st from London Gatwick to Montpellier with easyJet - a few of us flew out for a rugby game. My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers. As the price was quite cheap, I would use Easyjet again but I think their cabin baggage policy needs to be stricter as people will always try to break the rules.",Passive

BRU-Porto. Despite checking in on-line the queues at Brussels were painfully slow and long with check in desks (particularly luggage drop off) woefully undermanned. The situation was not helped by the new weigh your luggage and print your own luggage tags check in desks which people appeared to be struggling with. Despite a late change of gate flight took off almost on time and was pretty uneventful. The A319 makes a nice change from the Avro 100s. Service was pretty perfunctory from the usual Brussels Airlines older hostesses who whilst being professional showed little real interest in passengers - and certainly not those in B lite economy!

I couldn't work out how to order vegetarian food when getting the ticket and then when I tried to call the airline to make the request for the special meal I couldn't get through. I was a little worried as it's a very long flight not to eat on. The plane wasn't super flashy but it was a normal plane with screens in the seats for every passenger and there were a lot of Chinese movies (it is a Chinese airline), but there were more than enough English speaking films. The cabin crew were polite. I explained the situation as far as the vegetarian meal and they apologized but let me know that they had no record of request for my vegetarian meal. The meals were served around me and then a hostess stood over me, with a meal that had located a spare one from business class. For the voyage back I was able to request the vege meal and received the same service all the way back to New York.

Staff are very polite but I have never been addressed by name on any CZ flights. The chicken option from the menu turned out to be very delicious! The seat is quite spacious but not comfortable, CZ utilizes the same seat type for years. The current footrest is a joke - too far away and too low to put your feet on.

"  Munich to Sofia. The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew).",Detractor

"  I generally write reviews when I feel like there is a reason to commend or perhaps criticize an airline. Today I regretfully flew with Air Canada again from Vancouver to Montreal. We arrived 90 min prior to our domestic flight. The lines were especially long, and most kiosks for check in were busy. I went ahead to check us in and unsuccessfully an error receipt came out. I was forced to go into the check in line which had a wait time of 35 min. We got to the front of the line and found out that the flight was over booked and they wanted to put us on the next flight out. I was livid - how could they overbook the flight that we paid for? The Air Canada representative also had the audacity to mention that we were running late. After I firmly mentioned that I cannot get on the next flight, they magically found two seats right by one another. A miracle really. On my way from Montreal to Vancouver, I also did not have a pleasant experience. I had one carry on luggage. The front desk staff at the gate came specifically to me and asked to check it in for no charge because they had a full flight, and not enough space for the carry on luggage. I had some personal belongings that I wanted to carry on board, and in addition, I wanted to forego waiting for the checked in baggage to arrive in Vancouver. She relentlessly asked that I check it in, giving me no option even though many others had carry on bags of the same size that were not being checked in. I felt bullied into checking it in.

I asked for a supervisor Restated the same phrase over again. It is completely unacceptable to make someone wait for 2 days to get to their destination and offer nothing but a refund (or the next available flight 2 days later - the day of our return!)- which doesn't help because every other airlines quadrupled their prices to get a ticket the following day. Not at all a comparable consideration. I have never experienced such unacceptable treatment from any other airline I've ever used. Ultimately, after much discussion and begging, we were given flights at an airport 7.5 hours of a drive away so drove overnight, booked another hotel, to again try to leave tomorrow afternoon. Unfortunately, my Vegas hotel and show will not be refunded the night of due to No notice and we will also have to book an additional hotel room in Vegas as well.

The seat remained the same comfortable ones found on the previous flight, however IFE improved with a much faster touchscreen and approximately twice more content. The meal was much better as well, both in terms of presentation and taste. I think Garuda has done a very good job at producing flavourful food, even in Economy. On both sectors the cabin crew performed very well and were generally warm, friendly and professional. Overall two pleasant flights, would love to fly with them again now that I see that their standards have been set above competing airline levels.",Promoter
"Sydney to Vancouver via Beijing with Air China, and it is the worst airline I have ever experienced. Small seats, terrible food, undrinkable Chinese beer and whiskey (no spirits). I counted 5 Hollywood films on the entertainment system, the rest are Chinese. Two weeks after I booked, they changed my stopover time from 1.5hrs to 8 hours in Beijing. No explanation or apology. After I complained, they offered to compensate me by giving me lounge access. But not to the Air China lounge, it was a privately run lounge which can only be described as a dump. Moldy couches, no real food, terrible wifi",Detractor
LH 979 13th Feb 2015. DUB-FRA in Business Lufthansa Europe services greatly improved in 2014 and 2015. Very friendly cabin crew and the pilot provided detailed information about the flight.

Took two flights with Southwest during March - New Orleans to Nashville and Nashville to Newark. We were delayed a few hours on the Nashville-Newark trip due to bad weather but were kept informed at all times and we were impressed by the good humour and personalities of the flight and cabin crew. Definitely worthwhile checking in online 24 hours prior to flight as you can get a good position in the queue for boarding. Overall a great budget option comparable to our home grown equivalent Virgin Australia. We were rewarded with a $100 travel voucher for the delay from Nashville also - much appreciated. Would definitely recommend Southwest.,Promoter
"Cathay Pacific Airways from Kansai to Hong Kong. Check-in was smooth, but lounge is very poor compared in KIX. Old seat configuration and uncomfortable. As the flight was leaving at 9:30am we had a breakfast service. I asked for 2 glasses of Champagne for us as it was my birthday, and immediately the crew put a bottle at our disposal. Second surprise, a Happy Birthday card was given to me, signed by all crew, cockpit included. I was moved. Plus little cakes. And a renewed Happy birthday when leaving the plane.",Promoter
" Hartford to Tampa. The fact that we were significantly delayed tonight by 2 hr. 40 min. isn't even the motivation behind this review. It's not even the constant WiFi problems we experience every single flight. The main reason is Southwest's lack of heart. I was A-List Preferred and have flown SW exclusively for a few years now. I was three flights short in 2018 to maintain my A-List Preferred status, and I emailed them explaining that the reason I was short was because I was forced to fly Delta a few times due to Southwest cancelling or delaying the flights in question. It was such a light-hearted plea, too. I thought surely in the name of customer experience, they'll understand and appreciate the fact that I'm loyal to them still and they'll do the right thing. Not so much, unfortunately. Instead, I get this canned email response below. ""We received your email and appreciate your taking the time to contact us.

 Tampa to Springfield via Dallas. Terrible airline. I left Springfield on 12/30 and arrived at airport at 2.10 pm for my 3.20 pm flight to Dallas connecting to a flight to Tampa. Plane delayed 3 hours and 15 minutes in Springfield. Finally a rescue plane came from Chicago and flew us to Dallas. I missed my connecting flight and there were no flights until 12/31. No agent to assist with meals or accommodations at Dallas. I was confirmed on 7.15 am flight which was cancelled. Now waiting to see if the 9am flight will actually leave. Once AA sent me a confirmation for the next morning flight I attempted to book a seat and was charged $40.66 for a total of 7 attempts. Got an exit row seat for $48 and change. Had already upgraded on my missed flight on 12/30. Spent the night at hotel and paid my own meals. I will hope to never travel on American again and I definitely don't recommend this airline. I called customer service and they would not help with accommodations they offered a travel co for a discount. Lousy service.,Detractor

"  London to Valencia return via Madrid (out in economy, return in business), return with minimum connection time (1 hour). LHR-MAD flight was mediocre and the attitude of the crew left a lot to be desired, particularly their attitude to safety. MAD-VLC was delayed by 30 minutes with no information given (at one point, gate stuff packed up and left) which meant we arrived too late for our car hire. Inbound VLC-MAD flight was delayed due to weather, and later air traffic control. When enquiring about our connection, the gate staff at VLC refused to do anything and informed that everything had to be done in Madrid. We called the helpline and were told that nothing can be done to rebook onto a later flight either. VLC-MAD in Business Class had no service, the seat-belt sign was left switched on for the whole flight. With the seats on the CRJ 1000 being the same as economy there was no point paying extra. Upon landing in Madrid, nobody was there to meet our flight. We approached the customer service agent in the T4S lounge and were told they could find no seat for us (economy or business) until the next day. We found seats on Iberia Express but the agents maintained that they could see no availability. We then had no choice but to pay for the seats on Iberia Express in cash just to come home that day and throw away our business class Iberia flight home which we had missed. We were told when we called the call centre that the back office would have arranged us a new flight already knowing we'd miss our connection - obviously, this wasn't the case. We made it in time for the MAD-LHR flight, but because assistance was not given upon landin- we did not make it in time to the plane.",Detractor

Thirdly, the whole entertainment system was down about 3/4 of the time. Yes, they compensated us with a $75 gift voucher but the fact is this was my first time with Singapore Airlines and there were so many problems.

"Los Angeles to Gatwick with Norwegian, and the flight quality was decent. When we flew to London we were actually early, because we picked up a tail wind. Cabin service was okay, they are very by the book when it comes to serving the right people who ordered food, which is understandable since it is a budget airline. My biggest issue was that my baggage got sent to Dubai and not to London. So I was without luggage for a week. Nonetheless, thankfully my baggage did not get lost altogether.",Passive
 Bangkok to Paris. I was given overall good service from ground to air staffs. The seat was ok for me and the food was also ok. I loved white wine and cheese served during the meal.

That impressed me a lot.,Promoter
"I have flown so much, especially long haul, that I thought I had seen everything, However, to have a fellow passenger swear at the flight attendant (Brisbane - Hong Kong sector) because (wait for it) he had been upgraded, tops them all. I must congratulate the way in which the flight attendant managed the situation but it does bring home the point that airlines, including Cathay, need to be very careful how and who they choose to upgrade. The resultant dispute greatly upset all passengers in the cabin, including me of course. Add to this the constant problems I have with the Cathay website whenever I try to book some flights that are anything remotely complex (for example, 'multi-city') then I find I start to choose other airlines. Other than that the other flights were ok and the food was good - but not the wine. The evening return flight from Hong Kong to Brisbane is a winner due its very useful scheduling allowing one to get to bed before the next day in the office. I still recommend this airline but it could do with some simple management practices to overcome potentially unhappy and stressful situations.",Passive

 I had travelled on this morning flight from Mumbai to Bangalore on the A319. The web check in worked well and so was able to print the boarding pass in advance without any technical issues. The flight itself was a pretty full flight and the flight was delayed by 40 mins which was a tad disappointing but of no real consequence. The crew and staff were very friendly and courteous and were quite prompt to respond to requests. The seat was quite comfortable with great seat pitch which has to be one of the biggest plus points of the carrier. During the flight breakfast was also served which was good and filling followed by tea/coffee. Touchdown was very smooth and the disembarkation process and retrieving baggage was no hassle.

Air Canada has really missed the mark with Rouge. I understand this is supposed to be a leisure low cost alternative for Canadian going to southern destinations or Europe however I have found the fare is generally the same as full service Air Canada with all the benefits stripped away. The Entertainment system rarely works and the movie selection is very old/out dated. The legroom in rows 20 and back is very limited and if the person in front of you reclines you can barely open your tray.

Answers were either, that call could not be completed, check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now. I did not make it through. As an act of desperation I today called a British number. The lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available. Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a Sunday. So Iâ€˜ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customers.

"  Kolkata to San Francisco via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Did not make the connection in Abu Dhabi because of a minor 30-minute delay departing from Kolkata, and the pre-clearance was already closed for the second leg from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco. The pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi is Etihad's main selling point however, it's actually a huge pain and causes lots of passengers to miss their connecting flights. Etihad automatically rebooked me on a later flight to LAX, then LAX to SFO with American Airlines, adding 10 hours to my original trip. All they did was take my boarding pass to SFO and give me the new boarding passes to SFO via LAX without any explanation. No lounge access or hotel was offered to me. No one was able to tell me if my luggage would follow me, which was really frustrating. Got a middle seat for the Abu Dhabi-Los Angeles which lasted 17 hours. Also, cherry on the cake, the LAX-SFO was cancelled due to ""air traffic"" and no one told me, so I ended up flying United back home, arriving 13 hours later than originally planned. Finally, my luggage did follow me - surprisingly after so many obstacles. Anyway, easily the worst trip I've ever had. Not flying Etihad ever again, the onboard experience was a 3/5 but the ground experience 1/5. More importantly, just stay away from any pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi, you're likely to miss your connection and waste a huge amount of time as a result.",Detractor
"  Humberside to Sydney via Amsterdam / Abu Dhabi. They simply did not care. I am a gold member of their loyalty program - I booked my flight on the KLM website - after specifically asking questions about benefits privileges and differences - as the flight was a code share - was told there would be no difference. Lie number 1. I booked the ticket and went to book seats online. I could book KLM seats but not partner (the message on screen said seating plan is currently unavailable try later) - Lie number 2. I called after booking to reserve seats and was told I needed to do this with Etihad, I called Etihad and they said it wasn't possible and I needed to do this with KLM or at the airport: meaning that I would get whatever seat was available 3 hours before the plane would leave - for an 8 hour and a 14 hr flight that's just not acceptable - and certainly not like for like with KLM operated flights. When I complained I was told I could cancel my flight at a cost. In the time taken going backwards and forwards between the many KLM service departments other flight costs had risen significantly and I was trapped. After this experience on the way out I asked about upgrades I couldn't use points for the KLM part and I couldn't pay for the Etihad part my option was to upgrade to business class which cost more than the original ticket. I have done many long haul flights with various operators - KLM included - some code share some not. I am now sat at the airport waiting for the check in desk to open, I tried on the KLM app where it was not possible, they advised to use the self service at the airport - that's not possible. So I'm sat here until the desks open, thank you KLM. This is not as described when I specifically asked this stuff before booking. The flights in themselves were ok but this level of misinformation and poor customer service is inexcusable. I would not have booked this flight if I had been told the truth when I called before booking. And I will not put up with this again",Detractor

After a frenzy the flight was finally declared cancel with no flights out to our destination for about 4 days!

" Bogota to Aruba. We booked our flights weeks in advance and noticed during the check in period of our return flight that we were not able to do online check in. The only message we got was to find a staff member of Avianca. At the airport after queuing for long time we were notified that the flight is overbooked. Avianca overbooks all the time, why does the employee act as if she is doing this for the first time? Avianca knew 1 day ahead that flight is overbooked, why not inform us and avoid us getting up at 4:30 am and get angry at the airport? Avianca rebooks us onto an alternative which is also sold out, costing another 15 minutes to find another option - after making a picture with the mobile phone of their computer screen that person went away to manually print our new ticket. At the counter there are 2 employees standing next to the person handling our case and she is laughing and chitchatting with them about things which are not relevant to us. Avianca allows employees at check in counters to spend so much time per customer, it is not strange that flights get even more delayed and passengers even more annoyed! We did receive the the breakfast voucher since were rebooked to a flight 10 hrs later and flight compensation EMDS. I am very disappointed in Avianca as a national airline carrier.",Passive

"Price was good, competition between Middle Eastern airlines has now knocked BA off the radar as far as the Perth - UK regional airports is concerned on both price and flying time. 2 flights rather than 3 flights is far better. Being able to fly directly into regional airports missing out Heathrow is a big plus. Seat comfort not great, then no economy seat is comfortable for 11 hours! I did find the seats very hard and I needed to sit on a pillow. The flight was extremely full - every seat taken, good for the airline but not good for passengers! Food a mixed bag, good dinner on way back but no breakfast served before arrival in Perth instead a chicken dinner meal? Would have preferred a cold breakfast - fruit or just a bread roll option. A potato sandwich was served as a snack before landing in Manchester. The pasta dish was good and the noodle dish was excellent. Ground staff did take a bottle of suntan lotion bought in duty free at Manchester fully sealed in a tamper proof bag with receipt showing, despite being assured by the shop assistant in Manchester that it would not be a problem transiting with it so long as it was in the tamper proof bag. Etihad please communicate with other airports re this if this is your policy! Another point on transiting, I fully understand the need for enhanced security at the gate however once you are in the gate you cannot go out and there is no water available or toilet facilities in the gate. Also better crowd control was needed at Manchester as when announced that rows 1 to 3 could board - literally more than half the passengers stood up and started to queue, despite being told several times not to!",Passive
"  Venice to Toronto. I was glad I read the reviews of Air Canada Rouge before I flew it for the first time. It helped me set low expectations, which is the key to having a better experience. I was a bit nervous that our 9 hour flight from Venice to Toronto was going to be purely awful, but it wasn't as bad as expected. Check in was completed in about 3 minutes. The plane was on the older side, but was in fairly decent shape. The center bathroom in the middle of the plane is the largest bathroom I've ever been in on an airplane. Easily twice the size of a normal plane bathroom. We were in 25A/C and the seats are normal economy seats. It didn't feel more cramped than other economy cabins I've flown in. There is no entertainment available, so make sure you download the Air Canada app on your tablet or phone before you board. There are quite a few movie choices on the app, but most of them are old. We experienced no problems with the connectivity on this flight. On this flight we were offered a hot meal (pasta or chicken), a snack (bag of cookies) and then a hot snack (chicken or veggie wrap). Alcohol is available for purchase and the crew were constantly wandering through the cabin offering water. The food was decent and typical of other economy class meals I've had. I read a lot negative comments about the crew. Our experience was different. We thought the crew was very good. All of them were pleasant and helpful. Only one of them on our flight rarely smiled, but overall they were good. All of them are multilingual, speaking two, three or four languages. Whether or not our experience with Rouge was an anomaly, the key here is to know what to expect and adjust your expectations accordingly. And don't forget to download that app, or your flight will feel twice as long.",Passive

"  Berlin to Yerewan via Moscow. Being born in Russia, I have been always proud of Russian hospitality and the high quality of service. Unfortunately, each Aeroflot flight undermines my pride. I have been dissapointed, when my flight Moscow to Yerevan was cancelled without any prior announcement. I was waiting in Sheremetyevo to check-in my luggage (only two counters were opened for international flight passengers) just to find out that my flight is cancelled. However, one can see ""on time"" mark on the timetable. My husband was at that time flying to Moscow from Berlin to catch the same flight. Dut to the weather conditions, I expected the cancellation to happen, but what happened next, demonstrates the complete lack of Aeroflot`s ability to organize the passenger flow in such situations. My husband eventually got stuck in the transit zone with the flight information ""on time"", no Aeroflot personnel and people, who were sleeping on the mattresses! He found an Aeroflot representative only after an hour of running through different terminals of Sheremetyevo airport. At the same time I was literally fighting to get the same-day-flight to Yerevan (2 ladies at the counter for over 200 passengers), while the Aeroflot representative was extremely impolite and borderline offensive. Eventually, I got a flight 3 hours later (which got delayed for 3 more hours), and my husband managed to get a flight 3 hours (plus 1 hour delay) after my delayed flight. Waiting time at Sheremetyevo was more than 10 hours. We could not even fly together. They still had seats but they pointed out that it ""is too difficult for them"". No food or hotel were provided, not even a bottle of water. Anyway, the whole time all I wanted to hear was: ""We are sorry for your inconvenience. Your possible options would be"". That is what I expect instead of misleading information, disrespectful personnel and tricks Ã  la ""how to not provide hotel by stating the wrong time of the flight"".

The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service, both left reasonably in time but arrived spot on time at destination. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed muffin and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise no coffee or tea was offered, probably due to the 40min. flying time. The outbound flight to Hannover was a brand new Embrear 175 while the return flight was operated by a Fokker 70. Both aircraft are fitted wit leather-covered slimline seats, however the older Fokker offers a more generous legroom then the Embrear. Cabin crew were friendly and professional.",Passive

If you read what the site says during booking, the journey could be flawless.",Promoter
" Edmonton to Oslo via Keflavik. Never again. Ok I have been on the waiting line for 2.5 hours. Customer service is horrible. I could not believe that such a terrible service exists. My flight is from Edmonton to Iceland to Norway and I only have one hour stop in Iceland. They said they cannot connect my flight and I have to collect my bag in Iceland and check in again.

In short acceptable service. Flight left and arrived on time. However, BA should take note that for this route, Emirates were less expensive and would have offered an A380 offering on both legs. The reason for choosing BA was the fact it was a direct service.",Passive

" Milan to Shanghai via Zurich. I go the the airport, I drop my bag, I queue 40 minutes at the gate for security checks and, after that, I go to the duty free. While walking around, I look at the screen and notice that my flight to Zurich has been cancelled. I walk back to the metal detectors area and I ask what I should do. They give me instruction on how to exit the airport from the duty free area and they suggest I go back to the check in desks and ask for a new ticket. I exit a door and I find myself in the arrivals area. I walk around the airport and go back to the departures. I finally arrive to the check in desk and I ask for a new ticket. They guy puts me in the next flight with a 50 minutes connection time to run to the next flight. When he is about to print the new ticket, he asks me if I have any bag to check in. So I tell him that I have already checked in my bag before. He replies that I have to go back to the arrivals, walk to the Lost & Found Items office to get my bag and then go back to his desk. They are not only cancelling my flight but I also have to do their job in fixing the bag situation! I walk again all the way to the arrival, I go the office and they let me access to the luggage area. I get my bag and walk again to the check in desk. I finally get my new ticket, drop again the bag and I ask for an express pass because I have already queued for 40 minutes and I don't want to waste my time again. I ask for a special pass at the Zurich airport cause I have to go thru borders and I only have 50 minutes available. The guy refuses to do so because these privileges are only given to First Class passengers. After all this drama, I finally go on the plane and I understand why they have cancelled my flight. The plane was basically empty and they were flying passengers of 2 different flights. I arrive in Zurich, run to the second flight and I eventually arrive in Shanghai. When I get my bag I discover that it is broken. Arrives the day I have to fly back to Milano. Flight is at 9.50am and because it takes me 1 hour by car to get to the airport, I get up at 5 to get ready. At 5.30 I check my emails and I see 2 emails from Swiss that they sent me both at 4.20. First email: SWISS Flight Delay Information: LX189/11Dec2017 - Flight is delayed 2 hours Second email: Dear SWISS Customer. We regret to inform you that your original travel itinerary can no longer be granted due to an irregularity to one of your flights. Therefore we have rebooked you to another solution. I am sleepy and I don't understand what is going on so I try to call the customer service. Too early, and the China CC is still close. I try to call few European CC and I can't get thru. I decide to go to the airport and see what is going on. They put me on a Finnair flight from Shanghai to Milano via Helsinki. I eventually arrive in Milano at the same time I was expected to arrive if I was flying with them. Despite both times they found me a solution, I just cannot accept and consider normal to have so many problems on 2 out of 2 flights.",Detractor
"First class Beijing to Sydney. They started boarding economy class passengers before first and business! It was only when staff noticed me standing in the first class queue that they figured that I should probably go in now. The first class cabin is nice and I liked my seat. However, service onboard was horrible. The flight attendant barely spoke English, and when she asked what I wanted for dinner, I didn't understand half the choices. There was no printed menu, so I had to make a choice based on what little words I were able to grab from the flight attendant. The food was okay. There were maybe 5 dishes that were mostly good, except for the main dish which was some type of meat that didn't taste good. I didn't get a wine list at any point. The entertainment system was ok, but not that many choices in terms of US films and shows. And the ones available had Chinese subtitles that you couldn't turn off. And before each title started there were long commercials. After the flight attendant turned my seat into a comfy bed, I didn't see her for the next 8 hours or so. She didn't set foot in the cabin. So no way to order more drinks or snacks. And there was no bar or lounge area. I saw the flight attendant again maybe an hour before landing when it was time for breakfast. Food was good and comprehensive. Generally I would not recommend Air China if you plan to shell out for a first class ticket!",Detractor
" Flew Hong Kong to London with Cathay Pacific. The menu option read exactly ""Mushroom fusilli and tomato concasse"", however it was just one small mushroom sliced 5 times garnishing pasta with a tomato sauce. I believe ""tomato concasse"" would normally be crushed tomatoes. No sign of that. The menu option was, Stir fried egg noodles with chicken, vegetables and 2 dumplings. However the amount of chicken and vegetables could be held on one tablespoon. It was essentially just stir fried noodles. The dumplings were small but good. I understand I was flying economy and wasn't expecting Haute Cuisine, however using fancy words to describe something so substandard is just wrong and leads to disappointment when other menu options could have been chosen. The wine was nice but one small glass was less than some other airlines serve. Other aspects of the trip were really good including the plane and service etc. However it would have been good to be able to select a seat and not have one automatically allocated as someone taller than 6 foot could be uncomfortable in a 78 cm pitched seat.",Passive

"Air India maintained timely performance on all my segments. Beyond that, everything is downhill. Air India crew keeps their luggage on the First Class overhead bin. There was no room for me to place my hand luggage. Air India staff (head inflight attendant) told me to go keep it somewhere else or just leave it on the floor! Note: this is the response for a First Class Passenger! Meals were not served in First Class (at least the breakfast). No one came and spoke to you or welcomed you. If meals were served on-demand, on should let the passenger know - right? It was different when checking in though - staff escorted you to the lounge. For some reason, food items that need to be cold (cheese especially) were all in room temperature - not sure why and was not appealing to the taste buds. Food presentation was horrible. Inconsistent service and very chaotic inside the plane throughout the flight. There was no orderliness. Air India is cutting costs and one can tell. Entertainment sucks - especially the TV quality. Inflight map did not work. Looking at flight attendants and their attitude one wonders how they would cope in emergencies. I will not fly them again.",Detractor

The pane was new and clean, flight crew was good, although even on an international flight, only soft drinks, juice, water are complimentary. Anything else has a price.

If the inconsiderate person in front of you reclines their seat, claustrophobia results. If airlines want to cram more seats in their planes, with even less space, they should limit or eliminate recline.",Detractor
"  Los Angeles to Amman via Paris. They changed our departure flight without informing us, causing us to lose our seats that I upgraded. The plane was awful. I have never sat in such a crammed seat.

They told me to purchase additional checked in baggage online so I could receive a discount but the website and app both don't allow any baggage options to be purchased online-what? Then why tell me to purchase online. I opened a flying Blue card with them because I was supposed to get an additional discount on my extra checked in baggage, but I can't even use that, as you can online get that discount when you buy online - then maybe they should change their online service and allow those purchases online. I've have the worst experience on the phone with the customer service reps. Ive had the worst experience online with their website.

This is just to compare the ticket of other EU companies who will not serve you anything unless higher class and so much more expensive ticket or on board extra purchases for snacks, and not a full meal).

The SAS service from London to Copenhagen is the best value for money you can get. It's reasonably priced and you fly with a responsible airline and what appears to be well trained pilots and crew. They are always extremely professional and yet relaxed in the Scandinavian way. Most importantly they are reliable like no other airline I have ever flown. They arrive and depart on time there are no hidden fees (or agendas) and you are never in any doubt if they will care for their passengers or not. I will definitely recommend them.,Promoter

Manchester-Doha-Melbourne 20th Feb 2015. First leg to Doha on A330-200 not fully booked I had aisle seat plenty of room for my legs (I'm six foot). My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed and would definitely take the same route again.

"June 1,3 AF1233, Athens-Paris. Seat was a bit narrow and could have used additional padding. Meal was adequate, but not memorable. No inflight entertainment, and this was especially harsh on a flight that was almost three hours long. There was a three-hour layover at CDG. I requested a wheelchair to transfer from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E, it was a long distance. Excellent service. June 13, AF80, Paris-San Francisco. On this flight, I had upgraded to Seat Plus, but after boarding, discovered that I was assigned an economy seat, not the seat I paid for (I have since received the $75 refund). The seat I was assigned to was the aisle seat in the last row of the first economy seat section. This seat was near the galley and near the toilets. Because it is in the last row, the seat did not recline fully. It was very narrow and could have used additional padding. The aisles on a B777 are very narrow with barely enough room for the drink/meal cart to manoeuvre. During the boarding process, I got hit by backpacks and carry-on luggage as passengers walked by. Passengers waiting for the toilet would inevitably tap me on the head or shoulder. Two meals were served, dinner after leaving Paris and a snack before arrival in SF. They were adequate, but nothing special. The flight attendants were all friendly, responsive, and attentive.",Passive
Warsaw to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. This was a small plane and some passengers had a hard time stowing their bigger hand luggage in the overhead compartments. The crew was pleasant and I liked that we were served drinks and a snack for a 1 hour flight. At the beginning of the flight a passenger was watching a movie on her phone with no head phones and at a later point a gentleman was playing/changing ringtones on his phone and the whole plane had to listen to this. I think the crew should have told these passengers to use headphones and not disturbed the rest of the people. Overall I think the price of the ticket was high for the service provided.,Passive
"Our return flight from Paris started off on the wrong foot when I tried to check-in online the day before our flight. Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular. IFE was average.",Passive
Stockholm to London Gatwick DY4455 on 4th Dec. Flight cancelled last minute due to snow storm. Long queue to do re-booking.

"The term ""economy plus"" is a misnomer. Economy minus would be a better description. First the seats were the same as economy except the middle seat in a three-seat was left vacant. We had to share our tv screen as only one was provided on the seats assigned. My wife and I took turns being uncomfortable in the seat that had our knees up against the protruding exit door. As poor and uncomfortable was the seating it was not as bad as the poor guy in front of us whose seat did not recline at all. In addition he and the other passenger had no middle seat between them. As much as we would like to visit Iceland for a longer period next year I'm afraid Icelandair is out of the question. The cabin crew needs to spend less time catching up on the latest news they have to share and pay more attention to those that maintain their employment.

NCL-CDG-BOG-CDG-NC.L Decent fare during Air France sale and added benefit of avoiding overnight stay in MAD or transit through PTY with KLM. A little apprehensive after reading a few past reviews. Air France treat you excellently in Affaires and it does feel a little like business class used to be - something special. Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).,Promoter

"  Sydney to London on CX100, CX255 both on B777. Check in was quick and easy with fast track through security and immigration. UK passport holders can use the E-gates at Sydney airport which saves time. Cathay use the Qantas lounge at Sydney, which was extremely busy and not helped by QF1 to London, via Dubai, being delayed. We managed to get a seat, but the lounge was not good. Once on board the familiar good service from Cathay, with very attentive and polite cabin crew. Champagne Deutz, Brut Classic to start was very welcome. Meal service was good, my wife and I both had the seared barramundi, which was tasty and light. Film selection was updated for the new month and included some of the latest films including La La Land.

CX255 departed on schedule, this flight has the 4 class configuration with a large business class cabin, however service was still very good. I passed on the initial meal service to get some sleep. The flat bed is OK for someone of my height (1.83M), although quite narrow if lying on your side with knees bent. Managed to get a few hours sleep. Cathay provide bottles of water for each passenger so easy to keep hydrated during the night without needed to call for water.

Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.,Promoter
" Stockholm to Bangkok via Delhi. The interior looked rather deteriorated and service was shoddy. The tv was held together with masking tape, and you gotta hold it up yourself!

I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words. This is the first time I've flown with them and I can't recommend. I've traveled on LCC many times and not one experience was as unfortunate as this. For the price - there are surely better options.",Detractor
"WLG-HLZ. Initial flight was cancelled received a phone call to advise of new flight details. Arrived at WLG to find that the new flight was delayed 20 minutes this increased to 1 hour. There is no web check in which is unbelievable for this day and age and the self-check-in at the airport simply said ""we cannot check you in please see a representative"". The queue for the manual check-in counter was huge at least 20 people waiting for the one single person manning the desks. In addition there were no empty seats within several minutes' walk of the departure gate and I was not given the particular seat on the plane I chose online. Awful - next time I'll drive.",Detractor
"  Los Cabos to San Francisco. Alaska Airlines is a great airline overall. Their service and staff, flight attendants are very nice and helpful. Entertainment can be good depending on which aircraft you go on. If you are on a flight longer than 3.5 hours, then you can rent their entertainment tablet for around $8 or $10. This includes free movies and games. If your flight is under that, then bring your own device and download the Gogo app before departing. You will be able to watch free movies if your airline has wifi. It's great that they have power outlets. Wifi is expensive at $16. You don't have to purchase wifi in order to watch entertainment on your device. The seats are a little smaller than some airlines and not the most comfortable. But they do recline pretty far back. It will be interesting to see what happens when Virgin America merges with Alaska Airlines.",Passive
 Delhi to Singapore. The second time I flew on the A380. The ambiance inside the plane was spacious and great. The service was exceptional. The only things that bothered me on this particular flight was they lacked international food to serve that I was served Indian food which I'm not used to. Another hitch was the on-line check-in where I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted as it was automatically chosen so I was put in an exit row which was a hassle for me as the TV monitor and the tray table has to be set up after take off only. Thank you.,Promoter
" Hong Kong to San Francisco. The overall experience was satisfactory. Check-in was smooth but I could not say the same for boarding procedure. There was no line for Marco Polo Club Green Member so most people were stuck in Economy line. There was no zoned boarding procedure for a B777 economy class, which was somehow unbelievable, so you might imagine the long queue at the gate which extended further to two adjacent boarding gates. The in-flight experience was fine: meals were served a bit slowly probably due to large numbers of customised meal choice. Cabin crew were often busy rushing back and forth to deliver customised meals first before serving the rest ordinary ones. Entertainment content was very up-to-date and contained much to choose from.

If you are over 6 feet tall you might feel cramped. Second we overheard a conversation between a customer and flight attendant where the attendant wanted the customer to change seats to accommodate a family that did not pre-pay for seat selection and was spread over the plane.

" New York to Sydney via Charlotte / Los Angeles. Unremarkable or even bad service is frankly the norm on pretty much every airline in the US, with certain well-known exceptions. To expect anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment, as reflected by the majority of reviews for this airline. Yes, I too have experienced the dreaded day-long weather delay, but I still fly American because they handled the situation as well as could be expected and they don't control the weather. I flew from New York to Sydney with layovers in Charlotte and Los Angeles. My domestic short-haul flights were unremarkable. I had a tight connection in Charlotte (40 minutes) which I made with no problem thanks to helpful ground staff. Both flights were on older 737s without seatback or BYOD IFE. On the flight from JFK to CLT this was fine, but the 5 hour flight from CLT to LAX would have been unpleasant had I not had my own stuff on hand. Legroom on both flights was more than adequate. I am 6 feet tall, somewhat overweight, and had no issues with personal space. American's hard product is easily my personal favorite of the big three, even on older aircraft. Beverage service was brusque and impersonal, as is the norm, but flight attendants were very good in a one-on-one setting. There were frequent advertisements for AA-branded credit cards on both flights, taking the form of promotional videos and several in-flight announcements from flight attendants. Some announcements alluded to cardholder benefits not actually provided by the card, so be wary of that should you find the offer enticing, but I believe this was more a misunderstanding of the product by the FAs than a willful attempt to deceive. All in all, American's domestic service is perfectly reasonable, provided you have realistic expectations of what an airline is and isn't capable of doing. American's long haul international service greatly exceeded my admittedly minimal expectations. My flight from LAX to Sydney, clocking in at a whopping 15 hours, was a brand new 787-900 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy, a definite improvement over the 3-4-3 layout found on most American long haul metal. The seat provided ample legroom and storage space. Carry-on bins were large and easily accessible. IFE was provided by a large, high definition seatback screen. The selection was enormous, but leaned much more heavily to films over TV. The in-flight map is better than most US carriers. The interface for the IFE is somewhat frustrating at first. The default layout requires frequent swiping and dragging, which the touch screen is not very good at. This can be fixed by switching to a grid based display system, which I did not discover was an option until we were close to landing. There was also a catalogue of music and books available though the system, but the selection was not very good. Dinner and breakfast were served to all passengers on this flight. Meals were surprisingly good, being flavorful and well-portioned in both instances. I enjoyed about 7 hours of rest on this flight, which is much better than the 2 or 3 I generally manage to hobble together flying to Europe. The 787 is a wonderful aircraft, and is easily my first choice when flying overseas. All in all, my round trip flight from New York to Sydney cost $1400 per person, an excellent value. I would fly American again, both domestically and internationally.",Promoter
I have flown Ethiopian Airlines 3 times in the last 4 months (DC to various countries in East Africa via Addis). I love that the airline has a direct flight to East Africa but I am getting tired of a few things that will likely make me use other airlines that pass through Europe. The tickets are good value for money but the more you fly it the things it doesn't do well start to grate on you. The food! Like someone else said it's bad. They have maybe 3 entrees on rotation (a curry chicken seems to be the most common) and it gets old fast especially if you connect on another flight and are served the same entree you ate a few hours ago. The desserts are often a soapy flavored mousse. The middle of the night snack is the worst- it is all carbs and bad! A muffin or croissant a white bread roll and a fruit cup. Essentially it's cheap and not good quality (in terms of airline food quality). Also they don't serve enough water throughout the 12-16 hour flight especially because you can't bring on your own water at the Addis airport unlike you can in the US. That makes for a long thirsty flight. I just got off a flight today where one of the bathrooms was completely out of commission and another had a sink that didn't drain. That's bad and I am not convince that these things get fixed between flights. If you need a cheap flight to Africa go for it but if you are like me and traveling for work it gets old very quickly. I want to save my NGO money and so Ethiopian Airlines is an economical option but honesty not sure that I can tolerate it much more. Also between November an February they did not change the films which meant that my 2nd round trip was a long flight without entertainment. That being said the system is good when there are programs and films you want to watch.,Passive

Varna - London Luton. Modern clean aircraft with adequate legroom. My complaint was that the Captain switched on the seatbelt sign shortly after take off and said that the crew were unable to commence their inflight duties as we were expecting some turbulence. After an hour of near perfect flying conditions the seatbelt sign was switched off and the crew commenced the service. It seemed obvious that the crew could just not be bothered and sat in the rear galley chatting and eating.,Passive

LGW-MLA. For some crazy reason I still fly British Airways and pay for Club Europe. Following this trip I have come to my senses. Apart from a Berlin trip already paid for in May they can say goodbye to my business travel. This was an Airbus 320 previously owned by BMI. It was not difficult to work that out as it was still showing the BMI banner inside. The plane was never used for business. All the seats were a miserable 30 inch pitch. There was not even a curtain dividing club and economy. Just how BA think they are going to get away with this type of robbery for much longer I don't know. Unless there is an alternative carrier offering proper club facilities then its low cost airlines for me around Europe.,Detractor

Amsterdam-Helsinki-Bangkok Business. Finnair get pretty mixed reviews so I was pleasantly surprised by my recent trip. The 2 hour flight Amsterdam-Helsinki was standard with the centre seat blocked but there were only 4 of us in Business so the service was attentive with very chatty crew. Lunch was hot and reasonably tasty and plenty of drinks. Helsinki airport was really busy but the lounge was peaceful if busy. A very limited range of food but enough and good showers. A330 to Bangkok was new looking and very clean. With only 5 people in Business I had plenty of choice of seats. The seat converted to a fully flat bed with decent sized pillows and nice thick duvet. Choice of TV and films wasn't huge but enough. The food was really good and tasty if simple. Again the cabin crew were very professional and friendly.,Promoter

The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff.

"Round-trip flight from Quito Ecuador to Birmingham Alabama with one stop in Atlanta. The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta.

GIG-OPO-LIS on Jan 18 GIG-OPO on an old Airbus 330-200 OPO-LIS on an A319 both legs in Business Class both flights on time with an easy transfer at OPO FA's were attentive and friendly and showed Portuguese hospitality on board. However the transatlantic flight was on an old Airbus 330-200 with angle flat seats in an old style 2-2-2 configuration that were not really that comfortable for sleeping and a vintage entertainment system from the 80s with bad screens showing a couple of films in a loop with even no way to finding out when a film actually starts. What was surprising was that the cabin actually did not look that old and quite fresh. No idea why TP kept the old style seats and the useless entertainment system when they freshened up the plane. Dinner served out of GIG was nicely presented and ok but not stellar. CanapÃ©s Smoked Trout (or two other choices) and soup for starters and SautÃ©ed Seafood with Veggies (or Chicken with Lentils or Brazilian Style Dried Beef or Spinach Lasagne) for mains. Portuguese Wines served were good. However the limited cold breakfast (cold cuts and yoghurt) served before landing after such a long flight was definitely not adequate for Business Class. TP uses the Gol Lounge in GIG. While the lounge was comfortable the offerings available were in line with the discount character of Gol and disappointing. OPO-LIS was just a 30 minutes short hop with water served and actually no service to be expected for such a short flight. Most of the Business Class cabin was occupied by TP staff with paying Business Class passengers seated in middle seats while TP staff has been allocated bulkhead seats aisle seats etc. Just a short hop so tolerable but a weird mind set regarding customer orientation. Transfer and EU immigration in OPO fast and easy and shared lounge used by TP in OPO comfortable and nice. All in all a discount Business Class experience but not an unpleasant flight and on-time arrival. However flight to Brazil with LX was a much better experience. TP needs to retire or update these old planes to offer a really competitive transatlantic product. If available at a substantial discount I would not rule TP out for another long haul flight again.

We finally left Barcelona at 4:30 with one apology from the new pilot and got back to Birmingham for 6pm - 5 hours behind schedule, its understandable that they had to turn around, but they should sort out communication with customers in these events",Detractor
"Outbound flight was cancelled and try calling customer and after waiting for over an hour, I had to make another reservation on another airline. Coming back, the flight was cancelled as well. Again, when I received the notice, I could not reach customer service after holding for over an hour. If you are a leisure traveler and have no deadlines to meet, I think flying Spirit is ok. If you need to attend a meeting, do not fly this airline.",Detractor
" San Francisco to Kansas City. United Airlines was terrible from the moment we stepped foot in the airport. One employee would tell us that our bags would be fine to carry On, while another would tell us that we'd have to check them, just minutes before boarding when it was already too late. We ended up being stuck in San Francisco, CA and needed to just take the second leg of our trip instead of starting with Bakersfield to San Fran, San Fran to Kansas City because we ended up being stuck in San Fram due to a family emergency. We called customer service and explained the situation to which they replied that our entire flight would have to be cancelled due to a ""No show"" since we wouldn't be on the bakersfield to San Fran flight. We explained the situation again and stated that we'd still be paying for the flight but just wouldn't be on it. They eventually said that they got it taken care of and that we could take the San Fran to Kansas City flight and skip Bakersfield so we were under the impression that everything was taken care of. The next day (the day before the flight), we went to check in to our flights and were unable to do so on the United Airlines app on our phones. We called customer service again and were told that our flight was cancelled completely and that we were going to owe $380 each plus what we had already paid for our flights in order to get them reinstated due to ""fare changes"" and we would have to take the Bakersfield to San Fran connection again. We explained again that this was not possible and what we were told the day before about not having to take the bakersfield part of the flight and that we were told everything was taken care of. The customer service representative stated there was nothing they could do and that we'd have to pay the fee and take the connecting flight if we wanted to make it back to KC. When asked to speak with a manager we were placed on hold for almost 30 minutes and then they came back to tell us that it was a mistake on their end and we were able to take San Fran to KC with no additional charges. While on the San Fran flight the flight attendant was extremely rude. There was a line of people trying to board and she attempted to push past me to close one of the overhead compartments. I asked her if she could wait until we sat down and she said, ""I need to close these now! They're full! Back up for a minute"" In a very brisk and rude manner. She was slamming the doors on the compartments and pushing past people. A couple minutes later when she seemed to be over her tirade, another gentleman on the plane asked her if she was having a rough day. She stated, ""I left something expensive on one of the other planes and they wouldn't give it back."" He said, ""I'm sorry to hear that I hope your day gets better."" To which she then continued to go slam more of the overhead compartments and order the passengers around. My entire United Airlines experience has been awful and we will not be using them again. Terrible customer service is an understatement.",Detractor
"San Francisco to Milan via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Check in was a nightmare. The gate employee didn't communicate seat information, and didn't respond to my concern that my bag would get lost (as it did twice in the past with Turkish Airlines). I spoke with two different managers on basic questions of Turkish Airlines policy, and they were just rude. Each of them asked me to repeat all the information I had already provided (an annoyingly obvious tactic to tire the customer), and then proceeded to quote policy unrelated to my question. Besides saying sir as if it were a four-letter word, and twice rolling their eyes (two different managers) with accompanying tone of condescension, one manager asked me ""are you on medication?"" Terrible service. Terrible quality. A mean, cynical, and dismissive handling of the customer. So much for Turkish Airlines Gold Premier service! I will never fly Turkish Airlines again, if I can help it.",Detractor
Barcelona-Madrid-Chicago business class. We had very low expectations but were pleasantly surprised. The VIP lounges in BCN and MAD were very comfortable with a nice range of snacks and beverages. BCN-MAD sector was your regular short haul J class service with a reasonable breakfast. Upon boarding the MAD-ORD sector we were served pre take off drinks by and friendly and happy crew. They handed out cute amenity kits and served a lovely four course meal with matching Spanish wines. The cabin manager introduced herself to the entire cabin individually and took our lunch orders. Just prior to landing in ORD she again went through the cabin thanking everyone. Another light meal was serviced before landing and there were snacks available in the galley between services. The bathrooms were kept clean and all of the crew were friendly the entire trip. The seats were well maintained and fully flat although this aircraft was not fitted with the new IB seats. The only slight left down for the experience was the IFE which only came on about a hour into the flight and the choice of moves was limited to around 10 movies and none of them were that recent.,Promoter
"Travelled 5-6 December 2015 with Qatar Airways. Small Aircrafts (A321 and A320, respectively). Flights punctual, baggage perfectly transferred. Though small, a decent, lounge access is now provided in Nairobi after a two years break (since the airport fire in 2013). Access provided to the Swissport Aspire lounge which is a 3rd party lounge) for elite travellers. Service onboard by FAs is world class. Food portions diminishing, but 3 still options for dinner/lunch on economy remain. Wines have now been reduced from four choices a month ago till now only two, red or white - both are mediocre though of Chilean provenances. The most annoying are the lengthy bus cattle-transfers at Doha (yes! They are still ongoing as the jet-bridges are far from sufficient). Secondly, endless announcements, advertisements, and even Qatar charity requests on passengers (""Educate a child"", ""support etc.."") disturbs the IFE systems to the extent of it becoming annoying and useless despite the good movies.",Promoter
" First time flying Asiana. I used 140,000 miles from My United/Chase credit card to get this flight. Though not my first time flying First Class it was my first time flying in a private suite. From the check to the exiting at Seoul Incheon everything was so perfect. My seat was huge and super comfortable. Meals service began with a couple of glasses of Winston Churchill Champagne and a delightful serving of caviar. The man in course wS a five or six dish Korean meal - bibim bap. I had a glass or two of an excellent Bordeaux - they were small glasses. Dessert was served and I had some lovely vintage port. I must add the table was set with white cloth and red rose. The table was huge with ample room for all the utensils and plates. The service from the flight attendant was just lovely - attentive without being over servile. The provided pajamas and the amenities were of the highest quality. The bed was super comfortable and very easy to sleep in. Best flight of my life.",Promoter
"London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. The A380 was great, but that was all that was impressive about this flight. The plane being new and cutting edge, sold itself. The service was at best, mediocre and the cabin crew showed their lack of experience in confusion and getting mixed up. With a â€˜light' flight, there seemed more a gossip and snacking culture rather than a commitment to looking after their â€˜guests'. I had pre-ordered AVML, but was told I should have the veg pasta on the menu, which I did. Then they discovered that the AVML was in the oven, so I agreed to try it out. The AVML was awful! It was as bad as a hospital meal, bland, tasteless, half cooked and not at all AVML. More like kosher or post recuperation food served by nursing staff. The crew apologised for not having AUH landing cards on board â€“ another example of Etihad Airways lack of organisation. Had it been a full flight, I am sure utter mix ups and confusion would have prevailed. The cabin crew did the minimum work and apart from the ambience of the new A380, this one really felt like a budget airline flight. Abu Dhabi to Delhi was a one-off experience! Long queues prevailed at the gate as staff was not able to handle the various combinations of passports, visas and baggage. The process was extremely slow with officials running around, and when we were bundled off the buses onto the aircraft, a compact A320, the cabin crew were not able to handle the seating of passengers, who were allowed to freely roam, change seats, bunch together, shout across the aisles at each other â€“ in chaos. The cleanliness of the aircraft also left something to be desired as one could clearly see grease on windows and unprepared seat pockets (litter in torn literature, left over chewing gum etc.). My seat cushion kept on slipping away forwards, coming off the seat frame. Its Velcro had seen better days. The cover on the seat cushion also came off â€“ a thoroughly uncomfortable situation throughout the flight. Once airborne, Etihad chose to serve dinner. The choice is clearly yours, but at 3:30am (AUH) (4:30am DEL), would it not have been better to have served a substantial snack or a light breakfast rather than dinner, serving which was an ordeal for all in cramped cabin space on this plane. My meal was once again comic. The Serbian hostess told me that they had run out of the veg option, so she â€˜could offer me lamb or chicken'. She obviously had no idea! What was the point proudly distributing the menu? I was served flat Coca Cola out of the last remains of a bottle of Coke and she insisted it was â€˜fresh' and not â€˜flat' as it sure was. When I said that I had pre-ordered AVML, she said that might be in the front galley. When the trolley service finished ten minutes later, I was half way through rice salad, bread and Coke, the â€˜special' meal arrived. It was OVML and had clearly been opened previously â€“ I thought it may have even been from another discarded tray! The most uninviting chow mein in it was clearly not my request. Putting Serbian and Swahili speaking staff on a AUH-DEL flight where passengers are likely to be 90% Indian, puts unnecessary stress on the crew despite their brave â€˜plastic smiles', and doesn't help anyone on the flight.",Detractor

Frankfurt to Shanghai. Old A340 entertainment - 2 screens awful.

HEL-MUC/FRA-MAD return. I don't like their new loyalty program downgrade. I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.,Detractor
"Overall, it was good. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The seat were fairly comfortable with plenty of storage space on the sides. The food and entertainment were fine.

"London to Dubai via Bahrain return on Gulf Air. Upgraded to Business Class on the London to Bahrain leg. Good check in, lounge okay at Heathrow Terminal 4. Comfortable beds with plenty of room in the cabin - only 18 business class seats. Service was good with excellent food and a good choice of quality wines. Cabin staff were very attentive. Only criticism is the IFE. In both classes, it was very mediocre to say the least. Bahrain to Dubai leg was in economy class. Not a seat free in a very cramped aircraft (A321). The only blessing on an awful flight was that it was only 50 minutes. The return leg was in economy class. Fortunately, we got exit row seats with plenty of leg room, but looking around, the A330 economy experience did not look too bad - food was fine, staff friendly enough and plenty of drinks if you asked. Given the price, Gulf Air was not such a bad experience. Would probably use again if better alternatives were at the then same extortionate prices.",Passive

"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.",Passive

The cabin crew seemed to be more interested in socialising with each other with a few noticeable exceptions, the Filipinos. Meal service efficient as opposed to caring, was told the WiFi wasn't working but could see passengers using it, think the crew member couldn't be bothered to help. Positives - excellent limousine pick up, lounges and connections. Entertainment first class. Don't get complacent or arrogant Emirates as customers aren't stupid.",Passive

I spoke to manager who reinforced this information. We were forced to pay $90. I contacted the company and was told ""they do not offer refunds"". Very disappointed.

"  Fed up with Finnair's intra-European stripped down European economy class with no decent food and just tasteless expensive snacks on offer, decided to try their business class between Helsinki and Paris. The on-line check-in is a breeze, like with most airlines these days. With no luggage, could head straight to the Priority security control. Otherwise, Helsinki airport is quite a mess and they've clearly forgotten the basic needs of travelling passengers, resulting in no space to sit down anywhere and very narrow corridors due to the fact that all space has been taken up by shops and food outlets. The Finnair Business lounge is bright with nice Scandinavian design, but even there, space is limited. Even the toilets are tiny and lack regular cleaning. Once on board the A320, a cheerful welcome by the cabin attendants who were trying to do their best, despite the limited cabin comfort and service offerings. With a fare of over â‚¬1,500, the only difference to Economy is that the middle seat is left free and that you get a meal, but without any choices. Alcoholic drinks are free if that's what you want but as in Economy, the coffee is horrific. No wonder fewer and fewer passengers opt for Finnar's European Business Class and I feel sorry for all those in transit from Finnair's Asian flights, expecting a true Business Class product, like in Asia.",Passive

I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me.

Food quality was not up to international standards. That was the main negative. Movie choices just OK and audio visual difficult to use. Pajamas were a nice touch. I read previous reviews of inattentive cabin staff. I did not find this to be the case. Staff was attentive and cabin and bathrooms were kept clean. For the money it was a good deal. Lounges at JFK and Delhi were just okay with very poor selections of food. The whole issue with Air India is the food on the trip and in the lounges.

" Las Vegas to Gatwick. After purchasing my tickets to Gatwick for my daughter's college graduation, I received an e-mail from Norwegian Airlines to place a bid to be upgraded to Premium seating. As this is almost a ten hour flight, I thought why not?! The bidding was confusing. I thought I was bidding $50, but actually they added $50 to the original cost of my ticket and added that sum to my original ticket. This made my ticket for one-way over $750. It stated on my bid that I had up to 36 hours from the departure of my flight to opt out for this. Well, it was over 48 hours until departure, so I felt I was in the clear! The first person I spoke to on the phone continues to put me on hold as he pretended to speak to his supervisor. Not understanding what the complication was, I was becoming frustrated. I had my itinerary, I wanted my original seat of 14J. After spending a substantial amount of time on the phone with him, he kept telling me this wasn't easy to do. Then, he hung up. I had to call back and start all over again. He finally said he would give me my original seat and would send me updated documentation. Which he never did. When I went to the airport, the ticket agent gave me my boarding pass of 14J, with no reference to Premium seats. On the flight back, I was confronted by a gate agent who looked at my ticket. Seeing it was a bargain fare, she asked me to weigh my carry-on luggage. She said it was 3kg over. I was forced to take breakable out of my bag. I had to pay $90 for 3kg. When I arrived home, they processed the extra $395 for a seat and service I never received.

The downside on the A321 is that the remote on the seat is in the middle of the armrest and I kept on accidentally hitting the volume, I had to fiddle a little with the head phone jack. Wi-Fi worked perfectly throughout the flight and it was free. All the flight attendants were more than friendly.",Promoter
" Munich to Seattle via Keflavik. I was disappointed to learn that Icelandair no longer allows two bags to be checked in for travel from Europe to the US. I guess they are just conforming to industry norms. I was assigned middle seats the whole way, even though I booked early and checked in about 23 hours before the flight. How does that happen? Not that it matters. Today, my flight was canceled due to a strike. This might have been unavoidable, and I'm not really angry. What I am angry about is that I was not informed about the cancellation until arriving at the airport two hours before takeoff. What good are a travel alerts web site and email alerts if you can't be informed in a timely way about cancelation and rebooking? Now I'm stuck at the airport for over 5 hours until the new flight takes off. Of course, I have to wait in line for ages to deal with the rebooking. I used to be a fan of Icelandair. Now I have grave doubts.",Detractor
"Managed to get my rather large luggage quickly. First flight was on time, the A321 was clean and the Flight hosts were pleasant and friendly. Hot food was served and had an overall pleasant flight. Seats were comfortable enough, they seemed to be the same as the one Lufthansa originally put on their planes and I guess everyone went with them. Arriving in Athens there was a delay of half an hour due to congested skies as its the summer peak time. Boarded on time again a friendly staff with a good plane. They are a great choice.",Promoter

TTN-TPA round-trip. Booked 1 week in advance and paid under $200 round-trip whereas US Airways and Southwest's fares were twice as much. Overall good value for money. In addition to the savings on airfare I was able to park for free at the Trenton airport. Since the flights were full we were given the opportunity to gate check our carry-ons and pick them up at baggage claim. This came in handy flying from TTN to TPA since I wouldn't have to carry my garment bag through the Tampa airport. But I would advise don't gate check carry-ons when flying into a small airport like Trenton. I had to wait in a cramped baggage claim for probably 30 minutes for my bag no thanks to the ground crew taking their sweet time. As much as I don't like the Philadelphia airport at least bags are going around the carousel by the time I get to baggage claim. Also although Frontier has DirecTV on the seat backs if you get the lowest fare you have to pay extra for it. And if you're thinking about purchasing snacks you better have a credit or debit card because they don't accept cash.,Passive

Flew from Montreal to Athens. The plane was very new and clean I had one of the most relaxing trips because the plane was empty if all the seats were taken I am sure my experience will be very different. The staff were not bad but after dinner no one saw them until breakfast. I found the cabin air very dry and the staff not once offered water or any other liquid.

Avoid this airline and avoid any transit through Istanbul. Recently flew with Turkish Airlines LHR-IST-TLV-IST- LHR. Cabin crew are cold unfriendly and indifferent to passengers. I was on a scheduled connection home from TLV via Istanbul with a one hour connection time. By the time the aircraft parked offloaded passengers and we cleared security in the transfer lounge I arrived at the gate 10 min before he next departure time only to be told that the flight had closed and I couldn't board. I was given a seat on the next flight home to London (1 hour 40 mins later) only to arrive in LHR with no luggage! Turkish Airlines is chaotic and so is Istanbul airport.

"Malta to London City via Zurich. The first lag was operated by Swiss. Check in was ok, the queue system and the display above check in counter was bit confusing. The flight was delayed but only for 20 minutes. Once onboard, the crew were friendly, seat pitch good (due to the new economy seats - good for short haul) and the plane was clean. Food on offer was minimum but it was a hot dish which was better than the sandwich offerred on Lufthansa. Transfer in Zurich was smooth as usual. Zurich to London City flight was operated by Helvetic. A bit disappointing as the plane looked old and the crew were not as groomed as the Swiss flight. Leg room wasn't as great but it's only a short flight. A freshly made baguette was served along with choice of drinks. Took off and landed on time.",Passive
"Horrible service, will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I took a flight from Lyon to Taipei with a connecting flight in Istanbul. I was informed at check-in that my flight had been delayed 4 hours, upon further check at the airline's desk, I was informed that I had a choice to stay in Istanbul for 24 hours as there were no connecting flight due to the delay. The airline would provide lodging, transport to the hotel, and I only needed to apply for an evisa online. Up to this point the service had been slow but fine. This attitude had a 360 degree turn in Istanbul. As soon as I landed in Istanbul, a few passengers who would be staying at the provided hotel, myself included, tried to look for a way out of the airport and onto the shuttle bus. We were met with inefficient and unreasonable staff, my politeness was returned with unbelievably rude attitudes. We turned from counter to counter, with the staff giving us unhelpful directions. A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave. Still, I was lucky as I found out the next day, a few of the passengers had to stay at the airport (for more than 16 hours) because they had not been informed to apply for a visa in Lyon and after running around the airport once again trying to apply for a visa, was met with unhelpful staff and contradictory directions. Sadly, this was not the end of my nightmare. The insulting attitudes of the staff I had to bear when I asked for a certificate of delay at the airport before my flight was appalling. Again, I was turned from counter to counter (the staff seems not to have the ability to direct one to the right counter at first request) At my last stop I requested the certificate and explained my delay. Shockingly, the staff with scorn and disdain replied that my flight was not delayed, why or how did I believe it to be delayed? If it hadn't been delayed I would have been on my flight that second, not running madly around the airport struggling with airline staffsthat seems to despise and absurdly question the intellect of their customers. The breaking point came when he asked me why my flight had been delayed. No, the staff did not have the courtesy to tell me why my flight was delayed but had the audacity to put that question upon me. I have been very disappointed with Turkish Airlines on this horrendous trip. Through my encounters with the airline staff I felt insulted and laughed at. I question the credibility of an airline without efficiency, quality, and professionalism, to call itself one of the top airlines in the world.",Detractor
We left Vancouver on Dec 31 and everything was fine except for the non working entertainment problem - the service was good and friendly. However on the return flight from Cancun Jan 7 after 3 gate changes we were en-route for Vancouver - tired thirsty and most of our $ spent in the airport- after about 1/2 hour in the air the stewardess came around asking if anyone wanted to buy a bottle of water. Another 1/2 hour or so they came around with a comp glass of water (about 3 mouthfuls) and then they left again behind the curtain - they were fixing our food I guess. They ran out of one selection just after of our seat (10) then they came again - duty free sales. Finally they came and gave another half glass of water or pop. It seemed as though their priority was to sell everything we had already paid for. Why sell water on a flight where they are supposed to include it? The seats are cramped together and its a tight fit for anyone over 180 lbs to even sit in the seat. The seats themselves are probably the least comfortable I have ever flown on - and I have been in a lot of aircraft. If the lack of service that was displayed by these stewardess is any indication of Sunwing then I will never be back.,Passive

Just flew 4 domestic sectors LAX-DFW-OMA and DSM-DFW-LAX. Ex LAX boarded on time but then due to weather in DFW were delayed for roughly 2 hours. Informed of delay by Captain and given updates. Once underway beverage service given inflight video shown. Overnight in DFW then to OMA next day. Flight delayed due to mechanical issues. Passengers allowed off plane after first hour cabin crew offered juice and water then granola bars. Flight cancelled after 4 hours. $12 refreshment vouchers given. Replacement aircraft and eventually got away about 5.5 hours late. Whilst this was an inconvenience I believe the staff acted properly keeping passengers informed and making alternate arrangements. Return flight I requested baggage to be checked through to SYD which took some time to organise due to booking problems caused by the earlier delay when I had been taken off the delayed flights but then reinstated. Only complaint was during this time our pre-assigned seats were given away and we were given seats at the back of the aircraft without the additional leg room. All things considered I was happier to have bags checked through and less legroom. I have been critical of AA in the past but thus trip they receive full marks.,Passive
SXF-ARN-SXF: Flights were delayed for 15 mins on both legs but arrived 5 mins late respectively. Passengers were welcomed onboard by friendly young crew. Food and drinks are expensive onboard but was only 1.5 hrs flight so didn't really matter but on the other hand Norwegian offers better leg space compared to its competitor (Air Berlin) and wifi service is a hit. My seat was near the engine and wings but was relatively quiet owing to newer aircraft. Considering price service and flying time I would recommend flying with Norwegian.,Passive

My husband and I were comfortable. I have trouble sleeping on planes but he slept the entire night. The staff were very friendly and kind. Our food was adequate and we did get drinks (perhaps because it was transatlantic). There is little to no entertainment in flight, but we flew over night so I really didn't mind. And, we came equipped with Kindles, iPads, etc. The only aspect I was irritated with was reserving a seat on the plane. First of all, it was incredibly difficult to navigate their website and calls made to their customer service was equally irritating. Not only was the process frustrating, but I had to pay per seat to reserve them. Whatever savings I had on the ticket was essentially negated by this additional fee. I would fly them again, however, if the price was right.",Passive

"  Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong. I have previously flown Cathay Pacific long haul and regionally within Asia in business class and have nothing but praise for the whole experience. This was the first time I have flown in coach with them. My only complaint is the seat itself. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I was in the first row of the economy section so leg room was also partially restricted because of the bulkhead, but it also had virtually no recline and the seat back was almost like a piece of wood. The flight was almost 5 hours and was pretty uncomfortable. Not taking the bulkhead would have been better as I would have at least been able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I'm only 5' 10"" so it's not like I'm overly tall. If you do want bulkhead in the first row then select the 3 seats on the window side as they do have more legroom. Aside from the seats everything else was great. The IFE is extensive and the service and food were very good. I'll still fly Cathay Pacific again but will just be more careful on seat selection in coach.",Passive
" Despite Cathay Pacific being more expensive than Air Canada (on average), I opted for Cathay Pacific on the grounds that they had the midnight flight to Vancouver - this ultimately means that I am able to maximize the amount of time that I have at my destination. Historically, I would've told you that Cathay Pacific provides a superior service, but nowadays, it's roughly the same as it's competitors. They have more attentive flight attendants and better IFE choices, but that's about it. The food is okay, but I feel that Air Canada has better food, and despite having wider seats than the former, I still find that Air Canada seats and the cabin as a whole feel more comfy (maybe it's all the mood lighting). CX888 still operates the 777-300ER exclusively, and while I love 777s, Cathay decided against installing wifi on them. I do applaud Cathay's commitment to cabin cleanliness - I don't get any nasty surprises by taking my shoes of or putting my bag on the floor, and they do provide plenty of bathrooms for people. To date, Cathay is still the only airline where I can walk over to the galley and get whatever unhealthy snacks and beverages I want without anyone raising an eyebrow, so that's nice too, but otherwise if you have some time to spend, and you are operating on a tight budget, the Cathay experience is no longer a distinguishing feature for the airline. I for one would pick the cheaper option whenever feasible - the experience isn't all that different anyway.",Passive

April 27 2013 we took an A330 Airbus from Dublin to Orlando direct. The food was the best I have had on an airline. All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs! Also the seat cushions on the plane are getting too compressed to have a comfortable trip lasting 9 hours. The seat cushions should be replaced with new ones.,Promoter
  Flew Alaska Airlines from Portland Oregon to Dallas Texas.

An awful flight experience for me. I flew from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and we were delayed. The announcement explained that the delay was waiting for the flight attendants. I shouldn't complain though because while waiting in the terminal other Spirit airlines flights were being canceled all over the place. When we finally boarded the plane it was pretty dirty. The seats had graffiti everywhere and there was still trash from previous flights scattered all over the place. The flight attendants were obnoxious during the flight they did nothing but sit in their seats and play games on each others phones. Regardless of the money you save by booking with Spirit the bag fees are extremely expensive and you have to pay for everything once inflight. I would recommend eating before boarding. I actually wouldn't even recommend boarding. Almost every flight they had that day was delayed or canceled. And if you have luxury of needing to speak with customer service expect a worst case scenario for your travel arrangements.,Detractor
BKK-HKG on a busy Saturday afternoon in July on an ageing A330-300.

Once the meals were brought round, I was told that there were no more of what I wanted and had to settle for a the second choice. A few minutes later I saw one of the cabin crew serving my original choice and asked if I could change my meal. The reply from the cabin crew was that it was the last one.

The problem I had most was there was no real explanation for the delay the plane was there the weather was good in both locations. When it would get close to the time they predicted we should board or pass it then they would say something like it wasn't ""cleared"" to fly. None of us knew if we were getting out of Baltimore that day or not and as time ticked away they did not offer any alternatives.

I won't complain about poor scheduling but not one plane was on time but that's minor.

The food was excellent and the customer service was okay (I had to beg for a bottle of water when i was dehydrated from being in istanbul too long), but no matter how good the in-flight experience is, nothing defeats the purpose of an international flight more than getting there and finding your luggage didn't arrive with you. Why do we pay all that money for the ticket, for a promised service that is only half delivered. anyway, my lesson is it is better to spend more for an expensive airline that delivers in every way than risk your holiday experience on what in my opinion is a greedy enterprise.",Detractor

Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.,Promoter

Then she informed me we were all ""degated"" and she had a volunteer she was going to seat. 1 minute 45 seconds has not expired yet and she says the door is closed and shuts the door.

"  Phoenix to Dallas. I booked a ticket from Cheep O Air for 10/26/2017 to 10/30/2017. Both red eye flights. Within days I found I had been given the wrong dates by my son for the Formula 1 race in Austin, TX. I then had to change the flights dates to exactly the same times, same flight numbers a week earlier. I new there would be a cost to this, but not what I expected. I paid initially 118.38 for the flight, then when it was changed, cheapoair charged me 25.95, I guess for the change on their end, but Spirit charged me an additional 130.00 for the change. This totaled 248.38, almost double the original amount, for the same flight, same flight number and same times. For an airline that you can't even adjust your seat back. No more Spirit, no more Cheapoair. Unacceptable.",Detractor
Very disappointing flight (DUB-AUH-SYD) recently. Etihad have been steadily getting poorer and this is it for us. No seat assignment on booking to the AUH-SYD (14 hour) leg. Phoned Etihad office in Dublin on several occasions who agreed to file seat request on our behalf. Online check in - no option to choose seats. Check-in in Dublin could not issue boarding passes for 2nd leg. Hour long queue in Abu Dhabi to find in 2 random B seats in the cabin for me and my wife! Give me a break. If I book same flight with VA I can assign seats for both carriers. and that is exactly what I will be doing in the future.,Detractor
LAX-CDG. After reading so many bad reviews for the AF Premium Economy product I was eager to try it out for myself. If you are like me the thing you hate most about economy is having the person in front of you recline all the way in your lap for the duration of an 11 hour flight. So with that said having shell style seats is very exciting even if they don't recline in the traditional sense. Upon entering the A380 PE economy cabin I could tell right away I would enjoy the experience. The dedicated cabin is small and cozy and the seat itself has tons of room compared to any economy seat. Do not listen to the reviews on here that say the seats are cramped because it's just not true. I have long gangley legs and I could stretch them all the way out to the foot rest under the seat in front of me. It's basically a mini business class seat and compared to other premium economy products out there that cost twice as much (Virgin Atlantic) it is well worth the price of admission. I feel like a lot of the negativity comes from people who expect business class for the extra money they are paying even though it's a quarter of the price. The food is nothing special and I agree that the bottom portion of the seat could use some extra padding. Service was great and the stewards came immediately after pushing the call button. As for the non traditional recline of the seat I found it more comfortable then the normal seat back legs sitting position of economy. The trick is to make sure you extend the calf rest and foot rest so your body is being supported in the diagonal position. Again I feel like other fliers are either use to their economy habitat and or expect lay flat seats that they didn't pay for. As I said before not having the person in front of you laying in your lap the entire flight is heaven on earth which is still a problem on many PE products. Please take it from me a rational realistic aviation aficionado. I speak the truth in all my reviews and would not hesitate to let you know my dissatisfaction if there were any.,Promoter

"Spirit must be the worst airline. My daughter was trying to travel from Denver to Dallas. She drove 45 minutes to the airport. When she got there, she was informed her flight was cancelled due to weather. That happens. But, I have two issues. First, the only option I was given was a refund. That does not help if you have to get somewhere. Perhaps more interesting is the fact that I was told by Spirit that the cancellation was due to weather. Yet the American flight leaving at the same time was leaving on-time. Now you may think that this is explainable because the weather delay could have been elsewhere. That is indeed possible. Except the plane was sitting at the gate. I feel I was lied to so they could claim weather rather than the real reason. Bottom line Spirit left my daughter stranded.",Detractor

The flight from Durban to Dubai was comfortable and the FAs worked flat out to deal with a full flight. It was very useful to receive information on the gates for our connecting flights, before we landed. The comfortable facilities of Terminal A at Dubai made for a very pleasant wait. The boarding and flight to Munich on the A380 was seamless, with the bonus of the best chauffeur drive experience and facilities to my son's home, that I have had. The return trip from Germany to Durban was equally enjoyable and pleasant. Unfortunately, I need to mention two negative factors - the one being the ongoing poor selection of food at King Shaka International and the other being the chauffeur drive from KSIA, which I would prefer to elaborate on in a more private manner.",Passive

" Aged 84 and 89 respectively we had the unfortunate pleasure of the worst flight in our experience. First delayed by almost three hours and then called from the lounge to stand on embarkation stairs for well over an hour in intense heat waiting to board when it was obvious the plane was not ready as the original passengers and luggage had not been disembarked. This was followed by a 'flight from hell' with a large family aboard intent on just drinking, with two of their obviously worse for drink ladies consistently drinking and creating havoc, making a misery for everyone close and extremely unhappy. This went on the entire flight. To make matters worse the staff served them alcohol the entire trip obviously the company's policy to increase revenue. So much for strict airline policy on drunken behaviour on planes. The return trip to Luton as a couple we were given separate seats, although there were spare seats available, obviously their object to get extra cash by expecting an additional payment for the privilege of sitting together, which after 63 years of marriage, on principal we would not do. We only travelled with Wizz Air as it was part of a package, but in the future I will make sure we do not travel with this airline again.",Detractor
 Boston to Hyderabad via Doha. Flight out of Boston left on time around 11:05PM. The aircraft type also has changed from an A350 to an aging Boeing 777-300.

The seat back entertainment system shows its age in the screen quality. However everything was working and they had a nice selection of movies. Doha airport was super clean and comfortable. Onward journey was on a newer Boeing 787-8. The legroom is still not bad. The seat width leaves much to be desired. No position allowed me to sit without rubbing elbow on the armrest.

"  This was my first time flying with Delta from Atlanta to Houston. I usually fly United. Boarding was at 11:20am. I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault!

Have flown Aegean several times to Chania via Athens. Returned on Friday 24th August. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens due to depart at 11.20. We eventually took off at 12.10 no explanation given. We were really worried as our connecting Aegean flight from Athens to Heathrow was leaving at 13.30! We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.,Promoter

I flew on two domestic sectors KMG-JHG JHG-KMG and one international sector KMG-SIN. Domestic flight was interesting. I checked into the Domestic Skyteam Elite counter at Kunming Airport and gave them my Garuda Gold card (Skyteam Elite). They had never seen the card nor heard of the airline before. Thank goodness I could speak Mandarin and understood the question the counter staff was asking another puzzled colleague and could tell them it was an Indonesian carrier within the Skyteam. After checking in for me she tagged my luggage with priority baggage handling which was only accorded to Skyteam Elite Plus members but hey I wouldn't complain. The one hour flight from KMG to JHG was short. It was operated on a B737-200 which was relatively comfortable on the second row of the economy cabin. I had the aisle seat and slept through the flight. There was no personal IFE on board. Water and a packet of candies were distributed as you boarded the aircraft. On my flight back from JHG-KMG I had the same puzzled look from the check in counter staff about my Garudamiles Gold card. The Skyteam/Business Class counter was not open which was strange. The domestic queues for economy class was long. Flew the B737-300 and the aircraft had a slightly newer configuration than the flight from KMG-JHG. It was a full flight and the crew were just busy trying to get every one on board. Flight was okay. Same bottled water and a pack of candies as you board. For the KMG-SIN International leg we had to clear immigration at KMG and collect our luggage. Get out of airside and proceed to landside departures to check in. Checked into the business class counter as there were only two counters and which every was empty served me. Again had to explain to them about Garudamiles. Flew on an A320. The best configuration and seat comfort with blankets provided. Before departure a cabin crew came to me and spoke to me in Mandarin welcoming me as a Skyteam Elite member and offered me a bottle of water and politely told me to speak to any of the crew members should I need anything. Thought that was a pretty cool gesture to recognise the Skyteam Elite members even for the lower of the two premium tiers. There was no individual IFE but there were screens on board which you could watch Just for Laughs without the sound. Earpieces were not provided but given the flight was at 1045pm scheduled to arrive into Singapore at 2am I slept through most of the flight. The supper was just a box of bun and cake some peanuts and water. You could ask for other beverages which I got an orange juice. This flight carried only 60 passengers and i was fortunate to get the fourth row of three seats in the single aisle aircraft all to myself with room to stretch. Overall I would fly China Eastern again. That's also because I speak some Mandarin and it was easier to communicate with the crew who were always polite.,Passive

The cabin was clean and generally well-kept, toilets almost spotless, food was edible and there was even choice between two main courses (chicken or beef). Flight attendants were polite and attentive, although some of them assumed a rather condescending attitude with some passengers (a FA said to a 15yr old kid next to me: 'Ok, just because you said please I will give you another chocolate bar!')

It showed your booking doesn't exist.Now the only option I have is to wait for the day and ask for the check in crew help at the airport. Hopefully the aisle seat still available.",Detractor
" Do not send kids alone with Frontier Airlines, especially if they don't have a way to communicate with you. They charge a lot and they didn't bring my son to the area to pick up the kids (Meeting area). My son is old enough to call me and that is how a knew he was waiting for me in front of the gate. It took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to him and when I got there nobody was with him or ask me for an ID, I just walked out with him.",Detractor
Pleasant trip for both outgoing (KUL-DOH-MAN) and incoming trip (LHR-DOH-KUL). For outgoing trip it was a red- eye flight at 3.30 am QR 851 (KUL-DOH) Airbus 330-200 with USB port near the arm rest. The journey was smooth without any turbulence. Two nice meals were served - snack was served once onboard and breakfast was served before landing. A small pouch was given to all passengers which include eye mask etc. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The transfer at Doha New Airport was a breeze although I needed to walk quite a long way from the landing gate to the transfer screening. Next flight would be QR 23 (DOH- MAN) Airbus 330-300 without USB port. This aircraft looked a bit old but the seat pitch was much better than the previous one. IFE was nice without touchscreen features. Two meals were served - breakfast was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. For incoming trip QR 004 (LHR- DOH) at 1505 Boeing 777-300ER with USB port. Two nice meals were served - lunch was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The seat pitch is good. Next flight would be QR 848 (DOH - KUL) at 115 Airbus 330-200 with USB port. IFE was nice with touchscreen features. Two meals were served - snack was served once onboard and lunch was served before landing. For all flights beverages were offered a few times along the journey. The cabin crews were very attentive whenever there was a request from the passengers. They would do their best to fulfil the request and they eventually did most of the time. I will go for Qatar Airways again!,Promoter
"  Las Vegas to Baltimore Washington. Terrible customer service. After my 11:51pm flight was delayed 3x so now it isn't taking off until 3am, I reached out on fb messenger. I had a reply assuring me she was looking into it and has yet to reply in the last hour. The gate employees offered zero assistance and they can't even find my name on my reservation, even though I've given it to him twice. I wish I could give zero stars. $644 tickets and I can't even get good customer service. This is our first and last flight, and I would warn everyone to stay away. Pay the extra money elsewhere. It's worth it to avoid this nonsense.",Detractor
After my much delayed China Eastern flight to Qingdao (see posting under China Eastern) I changed my approach and took an evening flight to Qingdao with Air China. As a Star Alliance Gold member I checked in hassle free at the Business Class check in and proceeded to the Air China lounge in Shanghai Hongqaio airport. Lounge well stocked with drinks and hot food. Boarding on time small delay taking off but landed on time. Return trip also took off on time but no meal service due to turbulence but who needs feeding during a 80 minute flight. We even had an announcement from the flight deck in both Mandarin and English. Arrived Shanghai Hongqaio on time. Overall a good flight at a reasonable price.,Promoter
 Stansted to Naples. They made me purchase Priority 2 cabin bags for the way back without telling me it was already sold out for the way out. This cannot even be refunded! I won't be flying with Ryanair anymore. Customer service charged me 13p a minute and they did not pick up for 15 minutes. Chat do not get answered before an hour.,Detractor
"This review is a combination of a complaint and a compliment. We flew to Santa Clara on Air Canada Rouge as party of an Air Canada Vacations package. First the complaint - prior to boarding the flight back to Toronto at Santa Clara Airport, my wife, my daughter and I were called to the counter and were advised that we had been upgraded to first class from our assigned seats in economy just behind the wings. We had been bumped up to first class when we checked in for our flight to Santa Clara a week earlier, and could not believe it had happened again. Alas, it was indeed too good to be true, because as we were boarding our Toronto flight, we were advised that we were now in the very last row in economy. The staff seemed to be confused as to why this happened. It was most disconcerting for us, and we asked why we had not just been re-assigned our original seats. In fact, it was apparent that several mistakes had been made in re-assigning seats, since the plane was delayed for over an hour because the passenger manifest didn't tally with the re-assigned seating and the resulting number of passengers. We complained to the flight attendants, who tried to explain the situation",Passive
"London to Stockholm flight was delayed a little leaving Heathrow due to the typical congestion. Club Europe on British Airways 767 does not have the new seats, but comfortable for the two hour flight. Food was okay at best. The Heathrow Galleries lounge has little in the way of food selection. Drinks on board plentiful, FA's good. I feel British Airways are lacking behind their competitors.",Passive
"  Los Angeles to San Francisco. I've made a point to fly Alaska Airlines most of my flight for its previous customer service reputation. I booked a flight first class using mileage in April 2017 and realized how terrible this airline has become. They cancelled my flight two days prior to departure and I received no notification or rebooking. I spoke with customer service the day prior after trying to check in and the agent was rude, short, and told me no I can't find anything to rebook you on. I asked her to check other airlines as this was their mistake and she said no. It was one of the worst experiences in 30 years of flying. Sad because Alaska Airlines used to be my airline.",Detractor
"  Prague to Luton. Wizz Air are inefficient and the boarding process was like something from waiting for godot. We boarded a bus to wait a further 15 minutes on a bus, to them be brought to the plane to be held on the bus. For 10minutes in a bus that doesn't fit the amount of people inside or for the flight. We then waited for as the doors opened and closed from one end of the bus to another - honestly I would have to be paid and unconscious to get on a flight with this airline again.",Detractor
